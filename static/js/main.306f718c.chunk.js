The second thing is for doctors and for all health professionals to really understand their rights. I've spoken to both specialists and junior doctors, and some of them think that speaking to a psychologist or seeking help in that capacity means that the psychologist has to name and report them; and that's not the case. The case is, if you're potentially at risk of affecting a patient's care, then they have to report you. If you're just suffering from depression, anxiety or imposter syndrome, it\u2019s a completely different story.

I set up a technique to measure glucose kinetics during an oral glucose tolerance test, and then we also started work doing basic research in collaboration with others. In the end I was running a research unit that had both a basic science and clinical medicine component. We made quite a few transgenic and knockout mouse models of diabetes. Then increasingly we did some clinical work in diabetes. Then it occurred to me that really that diabetes was being driven by obesity. I started getting interested in obesity and we shifted our emphasis from diabetes to obesity, because if you conquer obesity, you've conquered Type 2 diabetes. Since I've retired from the university, I've come back to clinical medicine. Now that I can't do research, I'm now working four days a week as a doctor. I've gone back to my medical roots.\u201d"}),Object(v.jsx)("br",{}),Object(v.jsx)("br",{}),Object(v.jsx)(jo.Subtitle,{children:"2. In a nutshell, how would you explain, the physiology and neurobiology of obesity and what you found doing your research?"}),Object(v.jsx)(jo.Text,{children:"\u201cWell, first of all, there's very good evidence that weight has a genetic basis both for diabetes and obesity. That has come from several studies in identical twins, both in terms of showing that identical twins are very much closer in weight than non-identical twins, and that identical twins are exactly the same in terms of degree of similarity, whether they reared together or reared apart. If you overfeed forcibly identical twins, some put on weight and some don't, but the twins track together. Then, finally, a study conducted in Denmark took 540 people who had been adopted as babies and divided them into four weight categories. Then they asked a question - is there similarity between these people and their biological mothers? The answer was yes. Statistical significance 0.0001. And there was a correlation with their biological fathers, a bit less, but it was still significant. What about the adoptive parents, who were the ones who fed them and brought them up? They found no relationship at all. That tells you that the environment is necessary, but not causative. The cause is the genes. The environment is the facilitating medium if you like."}),Object(v.jsx)(jo.Text,{children:"I guess our most well-known study is the one that showed how weight is defended in a way that the body never gives up. I like to tell my patients, we all have 10 hormones in our blood that are made by the small bowel, by the pancreas and by fat. Of these ten, there's only one that makes us hungry \u2013 ghrelin - which is made in the stomach. In Japan they found that following weight loss the level of ghrelin went up. Then, it was discovered that leptin, the hormone from fat that suppresses hunger, following weight loss its levels dropped."}),Object(v.jsx)(jo.Text,{children:"We had shown in a study we did that cholecystokinin (CCK), which is one of the hormones from the upper gut that makes us feel full after we eat, actually goes down after weight loss. In that study, we also demonstrated that if the patient is ketotic, the CCK doesn't go down. That was interesting. Then we did our own study where we measured not only those three hormones, but the others as well, and found that they nearly all changed in a direction to make you more hungry - so the ghrelin increases, the others go down. Then we found that a year later that those changes were still there. Then in another study we did on the rate of weight loss, we followed the patients for three years. Even though they had regained most of the weight, the ghrelin was still higher and the leptin was still lower three years after weight loss. Now we know that these changes are long lasting. There's some evidence that some of the changes are still there six years after weight loss, including leptin. That to me says that these hormone changes are permanent until you regain the weight."}),Object(v.jsx)(jo.Text,{children:"That's then changed our practice, because patients need to be helped in maintaining weight loss. In most cases, not all cases, this involves having some medication as well as some lifestyle advice about being mindful about what you put on your plate, about exercising, about weighing yourself regularly. I tell my patients if you gain just a little bit, just two kilos, then you need to go back on the diet to lose it quickly. Because if you don't, then each time you see the patient, it may only be a kilo, but that tend to build up and after a few years, they're back to baseline."}),Object(v.jsx)(jo.Text,{children:"Then we did this study on the right way to lose weight and disproved the myth that had always been taught that the quicker you lose it, the quicker you put it on. Not true. The regain was the same, but we found that the people that lost it more rapidly were more likely to succeed in weight loss because they had the ketogenetic diet. In between, we had discovered that ketones also prevent the rise in ghrelin. They have multiple effects to suppress hunger. Ketogenic diets are the way to go.

If you're hungry, I think it's unreasonable to expect patients to not eat when they're surrounded by food. Yes, there are those who can maintain weight. I have a handful of them. Ultimately what happens is if you focus on your weight issue, you can overcome this hunger thing. The problem arises when something happens to your life, when you're distracted. Some unpleasant thing happens, and you become distracted. Your biology says, well, this is the time to get me back up there. It's a defence of weight. When we were hunter gatherers, this was what saved us.

It's not true. No. All you have to do is avoid carbohydrates. If you're trying to burn the patient's fat, it's illogical to me to feed the patient fat. Why not get them to burn their own fat? The problem is the body doesn't want to burn fat. The body wants to burn carbs. So, if you deprive the body of carbs then the body has to burn the fat."}),Object(v.jsx)(jo.Text,{children:"The ketogenic diet (for weight loss) is not long-term, because you don't expect the patient to avoid carbohydrates for the rest of their lives. What I do is I have them on the ketogenetic diet while they\u2019re losing weight. The length of times you're on the diet depends how much they have to lose. Then we stop the ketogenic diet, and this is when I warn them about the increased hunger that will happen when they break to diet. So they're not ketogenic anymore during the maintenance phase and they can eat everything, but small portions. Here's where the problem arises.

In the end we agreed because this was a big chance to fight that myth that's unfortunately still out there, that obesity is the fault of the individual. We agreed, and then to my surprise, there were no shortage of patients who were willing to share their experiences, which was fantastic. Of course, we never gave the production company the names of patients. What we did was we talked to the patients about the program, and then asked them if they\u2019d be interested.

In mental health, even the things that we've discovered through research, are not available to people routinely. The vocational intervention program showed good evidence that it helps people recover but patients cannot access in most services. There's no funding stream to support that. A drug called clozapine, an antipsychotic, responds brilliantly to a third of patients but it has some risk as it may cause agranulocytosis. But if you monitor the white cell count on a regular basis, it's perfectly safe. The health system either can't be bothered or isn't resourced well enough to provide that extra time and care that's needed. So clozapine is not offered to patients or given later in treatment. Even when you go to the trouble of developing new models or new interventions, they're not funded or translated by government into the real world.

I think it's a good thing to come to it a little later in life and bring skills and experience that actually add something to the parliament. I'd say you don't have to make any of those decisions early.

We wanted to know are they valid compared to a Snellen visual acuity chart, which is the gold standard? We thought this would be a great study to do. We basically just went around the ward, tested people with Snellen acuity chart, and also with an iPhone app as well. Then we also looked at the app store, because there's a whole bunch of different acuity apps.

That's when we thought, actually this might be a good chance, a good opportunity to maybe try and foster some more research in the area. Also, rather than waiting for other people to provide that solution, why don't we just get on and do it? At the time, both me and my friend had done some other research stuff before as well.

If a patient comes in with a fairly straightforward diagnosis, there's a pretty predictable path that they followed through the hospital.

It was a fantastic period in the 1960s (when Michael was in high school, and also the era of \u2018sex, drugs, and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll\u2019) and through meeting lots of people I ended up managing bands. One of the bands was called Peanut Butter Conspiracy - they were never anything remarkable but we used to run gigs around town and had a lot of great times. The more people I knew and the more bands I managed, the more friends I had. I never looked back after that and it gave me a lot of self-confidence which I didn\u2019t have at a younger age. I became known as a natural leader and became a prefect at my high school. I went to Normanhurst Boys\u2019 High School (a selective school in Sydney). I used to be president of my local youth group and in the Jewish circle. Throughout my life, people have approached me to take on things and lead things.

So you have to decide whether you want 80 percent in clinical practice and the other 20 percent advising companies, founding companies but not doing anything afterwards or managing small time projects. Or if you want 80 percent to be on the medical technology side, you can actually get to do proper engineering, found and build companies and solve actual medical technology problems; then 20 percent you locum every now and practice a little bit. Unfortunately I haven't ever seen 50-50, the closest I've probably seen is 60-40. Even then, you can't run a company on 40 percent of your time once you get investment while being on call as a consultant- you still have to answer any patient concerns, any questions, queries."}),Object(v.jsx)("br",{}),Object(v.jsx)("br",{}),Object(v.jsx)(jo.Subtitle,{children:"IS CLINICAL PRACTICE OVERVALUED IN MEDICINE?"}),Object(v.jsx)(jo.Quote,{children:Object(v.jsx)("em",{children:"I think in Australia people really value clinical practice.

They can have the confidence to basically follow whatever it is without: \u201cOh, maybe I should spend several years going into clinical practice first or 20 percent of my time going into clinical practice.\u201d Although it might not sound like a lot like finding a company - if you need to be spending 20 percent of your year which is several months in the hospital - that is a significant amount of time that you would be spending, perfecting or working on your career otherwise."}),Object(v.jsx)("br",{}),Object(v.jsx)("br",{}),Object(v.jsx)(jo.Subtitle,{children:"MOVING TO THE US: WHERE STATUS IS BASED ON THE PROBLEM YOU WANT TO SOLVE"}),Object(v.jsx)(jo.Text,{children:"I'm not sure I knew about the really nuanced cultural differences before coming to the US.

There's less tall poppy syndrome- I never have to apologise for achieving a lot. Aussies always cut themselves down- it's just the truth. It's so clear to me when I speak to my friends now, how much they love to depreciate what they do and cut themselves down even though they're achieving a lot, which is a negative thing because you are not clearly showing to others how much you aspire.
