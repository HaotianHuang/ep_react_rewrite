If it had been five years ago before Fitbits became popular it might have been difficult for people to grasp why continuously recording information like that might be useful. That’s most of your job actually - to clearly describe to people what you are doing. Unfortunately, medicine gets contaminated with jargon, and that’s an enormous evil. It gives people a sense of superiority, but if you can’t explain things clearly, then you put the patient at a big disadvantage.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>My hope is that the device will improve independence and quality of life for people restricted by the uncertainty of epilepsy. In medicine you are let into people’s lives like no one else. You need to be conscious of what you are trying to achieve for the individual, and what they see as the benefits. Too often we are just treating numbers and pathologies. I don’t believe in authoritarian models of medicine.

When I got letter back from a medical specialist in Australia they’d say ‘Dear Nick’. At first I was shocked because in England it would only be ‘Dear Dr. Carr’. But I liked the informality, and I completely love the lifestyle, the weather, the outdoorsiness of Australia.

So we took a trip to Silicon valley and pitched our ideas to different people there. We didn’t hear anything back, it was always ‘oh not really, but come back later’. We came back to Australia a little bit dejected, but we ended up getting one phone call and they said ‘we love what you’re doing, can you come back and do a pitch’.

Generally, if you're looking for a diet that is going to give sustained energy, then you're going to want something that's going to burn slowly. Glycaemic index is useful, but it's not the be all and end all. Everybody is different with regards to their genetics, epigenetics, comorbidities and how they breakdown foods. Carbs break down into sugar. When I say carbs, I mean breads, pastas, those processed carbohydrates, which break down into glucose very quickly. That's why you get these mid-afternoon slumps, because you're getting a lot of your energy from these quick sugar fixes. I'm a fan of low processed carbs, high quality protein and fats. No processed foods. Again, one size doesn't fit all.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>In medical school when we're taught about nutrition, it it's not much, because there's so much other ground to cover. That's why we've got dieticians, nutritionists, etc. I'm personally from that school of thought that good nutrition and good exercise is the beginning of good health. You cannot say that someone who eats lots of vegetables, good quality protein and has a lot of omega three fats compared to omega six fats, is on an equal playing field as someone who eats processed foods and drinks Coke every day. Nutrition can actually really help with diseases. Food is medicine.”</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>Being a mature aged student</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>if you've been through some life experiences outside of high school and medicine, it makes a difference to the way we communicate with patients, and other staff.

When I did okay at school, [my parents] said: “why don't you do medicine instead?”</Blog.Text>\n                <Blog.Text>So I just went down that road. I was only 16 when I started university and moved away from home. We were the first cohort allowed to train outside of Brisbane. There was only eight of us doing our fifth and sixth year in Townsville, and we had to fly back for our exams.</Blog.Text>\n                <Blog.Text>The hospital environment was very supportive and we were very much made to feel part of a team, because we were the only ‘learners’ there. I continued on to do my internship there and I moved up the ranks. I became an intern teaching the medical students, then a registrar teaching the interns, and then I went out into general practice. We had some medical students in the practice and I really enjoyed teaching them. That whole model was attractive to me because it's what made me truly enjoy medicine in the first place.</Blog.Text>\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                <Blog.Subtitle>TRAINING ‘BACK IN THE DAY’</Blog.Subtitle>\n                <Blog.Text>It was 80 hour weeks, there was a lot of competition to start training programs; and I remember being the only doctor on call all night at the hospital. I think reflecting on that it was very difficult. It made for a very, very close group and it meant that you had to rely on lots of teamwork skills. It was amazing but I'm not sure that that's the best way to learn. It certainly gives you the skill sets surrounding autonomy, the way that you need to learn to ask for help; and knowing what's in your scope and what's not. It's a hard way to learn these skills, but I think they're very beneficial.</Blog.Text>\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                <Blog.Subtitle>ON GENERAL PRACTICE</Blog.Subtitle>\n                <Blog.Text>I decided on general practice because you can do as much or as little of anything you like. I developed a very strong interest in women's health, mental health, and skin cancer medicine too; which meant that I could punctuate my consulting with some procedures and something practical. GP is one of the more malleable specialty tracks. As your passions and interests change, you can adapt your career into that.</Blog.Text>\n                <Blog.Text>What I really like to do is design stuff. I'm curious about how things work. I guess that's why I'm a GP. You've got to work out what's your strength in a diagnosis. What can [the patient] do for themselves? What other people do you need to draw on to get them to where they need to go? I like to find a solution to a problem, and then reflect on how it works. Whether that's coming to a diagnosis with a patient or writing an education program and then evaluating it.</Blog.Text>\n                <Blog.Text>There is a hangover from tradition- the thought that you go into general practice if you can't get into anything else.

In the end he was released and one will never know exactly what our contribution was, but we were certainly pleased as whatever we had done hadn’t hurt. His family - poor farmers in Crete - were enormously grateful for the support for them and their son.

But we actually had a whole week on sex in second year, and I'm talking in the 70s, and we had a speaker called Elsie Koadlow who was working as a GP and she did a lot of family planning. People came to her with sexual problems, and she realized there was no one working in that area and she saw the big need. She actually went to London and trained in psychosexual medicine and came back and started the first clinic which was at the Queen Vic at that time, which has now become Monash (Sexual Medicine & Therapy Clinic).</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>She spoke, and what really impressed me was when she was talking about ‘gynae’ examination and she said that if you're doing a gynecological examination then you've got to remember that that is a woman lying there, with thoughts and feelings. I guess that was my first introduction to the mind-body connection. Plus, just the way she spoke, I thought she was fantastic, and I thought at that point ‘I want to be like Elsie when I grow up’.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>In fact, in my final year we had a magazine and we were asked what you want to be doing in 10 years time. I said I wanted to be taking over her clinic. Now, it took me 20 years, but the Sexual Medicine & Therapy Clinic at Monash is the one that she started in a different iteration. But I had a circuitous route, when I graduated there wasn't any direct route. I actually rang her and said, “What do you think I should do?”</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>After the early hospital years, I did a couple of years of psychiatry training and then I went into general practice.

I did training around 30 years ago in meditation, before it was fashionable.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>Can you tell us a little bit about the kind of work you're doing at the moment.</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>Okay, so I work in several places but it's all specializing in sexual medicine and sex therapy. Firstly, where we are at the moment, The Women's (Hospital), and at a sexual counselling clinic at Monash, called the Sexual Medicine and Therapy Clinic. I have a private practice and I'm also employed by Monash Uni, in the department of O&G. I'm seeing people with sexual difficulties, as the reason for the referral. They present with sexual difficulties, and I see them to work out what's going on for them.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I'm (also) currently working at Monash Uni developing a 2-day short course that's being held in April actually. It’s called Let's Talk About Sex: Sexuality & Sexual Difficulties. Day one we'll be looking at sexuality in general, and day two we'll be looking at sexual difficulties. It's multidisciplinary with the 11 speakers we've got, so that's very exciting. We've got some specialists like myself, so GPs who specialized in sexual medicine and sex therapy, and a sexual health physician. We've got psychologists, a sex and relationship therapist, a psychiatrist who is head of the Gender Clinic. We've got a physiotherapist, an endocrinologist and a gynaecologist. There will be very multidisciplinary speakers and audience. It's open for all doctors, GPs and specialists, and psychologists, physiotherapists, any health practitioner.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>What kind of sexual difficulties do you see most commonly?</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>Well, at The Women's we only see women, so the most common presenting complaints are painful sex or a lack of interest in sex, or lack of libido. Sometimes women with difficulty with arousal or orgasm. At Monash we see women with those problems, but also men with erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation, or other ejaculatory problems, and libido issues as well.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>What are some of the biggest factors that you think have an influence over sexual difficulties in your patients?</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>We've got to look at the whole picture. For any individual we've got a look at the physical issues that could be happening. For a woman with painful sex we've got to see if there's any gynecological problems, or vulval skin problems. Then, what's happening with the pelvic floor? But you can’t separate the mind and the body. I think when it comes to life in general you can't separate them mind and the body, but especially when it comes to sex. So, I want to know how the person feels about sex, how they think about sex, what's going on during it. Also, if they're in a sexual relationship, you have to look at what's going on between people. What's happening in the relationship? Because anything that's going on in the relationship can impact on sex.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Then there's the even bigger picture. One of the things I did before getting into this area was family therapy training. It's amazing how often family influence has come into it, either what they've learnt growing up or the family effects now. Then you've got to look at an even bigger picture and that is the culture that they're living in, and particularly in the hospitals I work at where we have a huge multicultural population. It could be traditional cultures, or even the culture we're living in now, in Melbourne in 2019, can have a huge impact. Sometimes it's one end of the spectrum to the other, so we've got to look at all of that.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>You were talking about this spectrum of sexuality and sexual interest, where some people might not want to have sex at all, and other people might want it a lot. How do you then discern someone with maybe an exaggerated sexuality or low libido, from someone being, say, asexual?</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>You really need to do a thorough assessment. The definition of asexual is never having any sexual attraction to anyone. Asexual people may want to have romantic relationships, or other kinds of relationships, but they don't want to be sexual. That's different to someone who has had sexual attractions, or someone who may have wanted to be sexual, although even with their sexuality I guess it can develop down the track.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>With someone who complains of a loss of libido, then a detailed history looking at how things have changed, when things have changed, and all the other factors. What I'm looking for is what might be getting in the way or what might be missing for them at the moment. It is important to take a full sexual history to see whether there's been a shift or a significant change. I often say to my patients that I see my job as Sherlock Holmes, looking for clues. I really get the story of their life, and I’m looking at it unfolding with the lens of how might this life be impacting on their sexuality. So, through doing that, you get a sense (of the issue). In that way, I think medicine is art and science.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>Resources & More Info</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text><a href=\"http://www.itstimewetalked.com.au/\">http://www.itstimewetalked.com.au/</a></Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text><a href=\"https://www.monash.edu/medicine/scs/ob-gyn/short-courses-for-professional-development/lets-talk-about-sex\">https://www.monash.edu/medicine/scs/ob-gyn/short-courses-for-professional-development/lets-talk-about-sex</a></Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text><a href=\"http://monashhealth.org/services/services-o-z-monash-health/sexual-medicine-and-therapy/\">http://monashhealth.org/services/services-o-z-monash-health/sexual-medicine-and-therapy/</a></Blog.Text>\n        </Blog.TextBlock>\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\nimport { Blog } from '../../components';\n\nexport default function ginni_mansberg() {\n    return (\n        <Blog.TextBlock>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>FINDING GENERAL PRACTICE‍</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>When I did my internship, I just knew that I was going to be an infectious diseases physician. I loved it. I think we all have a hero in our internship, somebody who we want to become. For me there was a guy - A/Prof Barry Gatus - he was literally like House. He went around solving problems and diagnosing obscure conditions. He diagnosed cerebral TB “They pick off the cranial nerves one-by-one” and I was like, “Man I want to be you”, which was awesome until I found out that I was pregnant. Then I looked around and I was pregnant yet again. Trying to work as a registrar with two little kids is really difficult.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>The flexibility that general practice offered became really appealing. What I didn’t realise I would love so much about general practice is the variety. You’re never bored because you never know who’s coming in next. You could have an upper respiratory tract infection, but you could also have a geriatric patient with multiple comorbidities. They’re really interesting and exquisite problems to solve and get your head around. You get to utilise all the medical knowledge that you learned at medical school and make a huge difference in general practice.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Anything in which you give your patients bad news is really hard and it doesn’t get easier; in some ways, it gets harder. I’ve known a lot of my patients since before they met their husband and had children. Since I’ve known these people for so long, any bad news is quite heartbreaking. Cancer particularly, is really tough.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>TRYING HER HAND AT JOURNALISM</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>As you guys all know, medicine is just full of stories.

The only difference with journalism is telling those stories in an authentic and meaningful way, in a way that touches other people.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>The TV thing? the media thing? I totally fell into that unintentionally. Nothing has been overly planned in my life. I was a mum with little kids and in medicine you’ve got to be there on the ground to see patients. It you’re not there you can’t work and you don’t get paid. It can be difficult to be there when you’ve got little children and you’re trying to get daycare and babysitters. So I ended up doing a journalism degree because I thought I could do that from home. And I did: I wrote for Medical Observer and Australian Doctor. One thing led to another and I ended up with my first gig for Women’s Health Magazine. I happened to join them at around the time they got bought by 7 network. The Sunrise producers were looking for a girl doctor to talk about topics like breastfeeding so they went to Women’s Health Magazine and asked, “Do you have someone we can borrow?” I ended up filling in for the Channel 7 doctor whenever he was on holidays. As he was getting older and didn’t want to do it as much, I kind of got the whole gig to myself which was awesome!</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>THE HOTBED OF POLITICS‍</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I had never read the Financial Review, however one day I happened to open the Financial Review and I saw an ad looking for somebody with health and media experience. I thought, “I watch The West Wing, I know about politics. I’ve seen Joe Hockey on Sunrise, he seems lovely. It’s not my party but I could do that anyway.” And I just chucked my hat in the ring. Before I knew it, I was moving to Canberra.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>The world of politics is really interesting, but I worked out that I totally did not belong there. People are incredibly partisan. There are a lot of haters in politics; they hate the other side and I found that really sad. When we were on this side of the building, you had to hate everybody on the other side and I didn’t want to hate anyone, so that didn’t work out for me.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>If you have a desire to do good generally, politics is where you could do some of your best work as it influences policies and decision making.

When you started working as an intern, you pretty much lived in the hospital. You had 100 working hours a week. You looked forward to being a second year resident where you ‘only’ worked 80 hours a week. Hospital residents were really hospital residents, in the sense that they actually resided in the hospital.

It’s like being in the army in a sense. It occupied your entire life. You had lots of resident friends who you were stuck in the hospital with the whole weekend. You accumulated a lot of clinical experience very quickly because there was so much exposure. It was also stressful because you were basically deprived of all private life. That was tough for a lot of people. There was a lot of fatigue because you would be called at night and then the next morning it would start again.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>MEDICINE: A LIFE PASSION</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>For many people in medicine, medicine is the most interesting thing that they do on a given day. Many become absorbed by the profession because it is so much more interesting than anything else they could do outside of it. For example what I do in my daily professional life in terms of looking after critical care patients and doing research is so much more interesting than just about anything else I could do. I often say to my wife: ‘well, what would I do? Watch TV or play golf or something?’ They all seem incredibly mundane and much less fulfilling and interesting and meaningful, to me at least.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>THAT INSATIABLE RESEARCH CRAVING</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I always liked the concept of trying to find out what's going on.

I used to go and do animal experiments in the evening in a model of glomerulonephritis with a very good mentor, Stephen Holdsworth.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I've always been a person who questions what is accepted as the given truth at the time. I always ask: are you really sure about that? How do we really know this? How good is the evidence? How solid is it? Is it open to challenging? If it is open to challenge, how could we push the boundaries a little bit more to understand things more?</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Over the years, that thinking begets work and publications and projects and funding. It become an avalanche if you will; a snowball that gets bigger and bigger because it draws more resources. It achieves more, is recognised more, is supported more and then spreads out to have research fellows and young registrars and trainees come from all over the world.

The results of our trial did not support its use: That led to a lot of acrimonious exchanges, accusations and personal attacks. It was pretty tough. It continues to a slightly lesser extent now compared to four or five years. It has however continued to be an issue and that’s unfortunate. It does happen, and we will not be the only ones.

For the first five or even ten years, if I wanted to, I could have just said ‘Sorry guys, this is no longer fun’ and pull the plug. However I now have a responsibility to the thousands of contributors who have volunteered thousands of hours towards creating content, as well as to the thousands of people who rely on Radiopaedia on a daily basis not just to assist their study (as is the case in Australia, UK or the US), but to make clinical diagnoses in countries where they don’t have ready access to the information Radiopaedia provides them.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>So now I can’t just switch it off.

One of the courses that I did in my second semester at uni was Introduction to Peace and Conflict Studies with this fantastic Swiss lecturer called Rowland Blackhead, who was just very inspiring and charismatic. We got to talk about genocide, war, politics, morality and all these issues. I found that super interesting and that was why I continued with that major. I wasn't really sure where I was going to go with it, but I was thinking of working for the Red Cross or something like that.

Later on I had a year where I had massive health problems which amazingly, I completely recovered from. Until that point, I had never really thought about medicine and how well it worked. I realised that these people actually cured others of their diseases and I then became obsessed with the idea of becoming a doctor, so I did the GAMSAT and went to medical school at UQ.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>THE SWITCH TO GLOBAL HEALTH: BRUNEI, BANGLADESH AND PNG</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>When I was in medical school, I did a term in Mount Isa and another one in Brunei.

I went to Bangladesh with JCU and that was the first time that I had ever been to a poor country. While I was there a Lancet series about the Bangladesh public health miracle came out - I thought it was very impressive that they had achieved so much, given the incredible poverty they have.

Another place with an incredible program was Majuro, the capital of Marshall Islands. I worked with this project called TB + Leprosy Free Majuro. The capital has a population of about 27,000 people and we were able to screen 22,000 over the course of 15 weeks. We found 300 cases of active TB and leprosy, and treated 4,500 people with latent TB.

As a writer, I think a lot of science fiction and fantasy is about trying to understand the broader world, and how the environment and society interact over time with technology. This is surprisingly similar to the things that you see in global health, where there’s a lot of shocking contrast. I feel that science fiction would be the appropriate mode to write about it. For example, I remember when I was working in PNG, we lived on the islands where our patients were involved in subsistence farming. They caught fish, climbed coconut trees, and dug in the gardens. At the same time, we packaged their sputum samples and sent them to Brisbane to test the genetic strains of TB.

My personal mission is to make sure that we can create a system that is more intuitive and empowers patients on what can be a very lonely and challenging healthcare journey.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Text><b>Tal is a Melbourne Medical School graduate who trained at the Alfred, and went on to take on the whole world of healthcare, from digital health and medical education start-ups in the US, to commercialisation and innovation at a multinational pharmaceutical company, to his current role - founder and CEO of his own patient-centric blockchain-based medical startup - ScalaMed.</b></Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n        </Blog.TextBlock>\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\nimport { Blog } from '../../components';\n\nexport default function sally_bell() {\n    return (\n        <Blog.TextBlock>\n            <Blog.Author>Written by Erica Musgrove</Blog.Author>\n            ‍<br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>Firstly, can you tell us just a little bit about your career path in within medicine and how you got to your current position?</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>Yeah, I guess I'm one of those people who do not really know what they want to do at the start. I was a medical student at St. Vincent’s. I didn't really like staying at the public hospital. It looked a bit boring. I thought I'd be an intern in Geelong and do general practice. I did that, and I worked for two guys who were physicians in Warrnambool on country rotation and one of them was a gastroenterologist. I thought they had the most fantastic practice with all these really amazing bits. I thought ‘this is really good, I want to do what they do’. They said, “No, you don't want to do what we do. You should do anaesthetics, which finishes at six and then you go home”. Anyway, they wrote me my reference back to town. I got a job at the Royal Melbourne, which is where one of them had come from, on the basis of their reference.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I spent three years at the Royal Melbourne doing BPT. Then I did my advanced training at the Austin. That was really nice, but it was too hard. I did a year at the Repat, which was very much a relaxed entry to gastro training. Then I did a year at the Austin, which was on liver transplant, the other end of the spectrum - completely chaotic, high stress, but good training. Then I came here to do some research based on the fact that one of the consultants here had said, \"Look, come and do some something with us.\" The Austin weren't doing much in the way of research, and I didn't really feel finished after my advanced training.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I did some lab work actually in the end. I'd come in thinking I was going to study alcohol and just talk to people about how much they drank. I ended up in a virus lab doing actual basic science. I was thinking, “Gee, I don't think I signed up for this”. It turned out that the lab staff were really, really nice. They taught me again about RNA and DNA, which I'd completely forgotten about. Now I have a group working knowledge of molecular biology. Perhaps somewhat disappointingly the hypothesis for my research was a negative, which was my first lesson in research. It was very difficult to get it published. It took a while before I warmed the concept of research again.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I went overseas and did some clinical work overseas and that was absolutely fantastic. I would recommend that to anyone who was thinking of doing anything. It's just a good time in life. It seems like bad thing to do financially and from a family point-of-view. It is from those two points of view, but it's really, really good personally. I took my husband with me. He left his good job, and in actual fact he ended up with a better one and he got an MBA out of it. It was a race to see who had had the better time actually of the two of us. We had our first baby overseas. I had two years overseas and then I had a year off, and then Paul, who was the boss here [St Vincent’s] said, “If you're going to come back, you better hurry up and come back.” I came back and took up the job as a full-timer, which I didn't really realize at the time was quite rare. I was just lucky the girl who was supposed to take the job, married an Englishman when she went and did her research, so there was a job opening. I've been here ever since - 19 years.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>I read somewhere that you have particular interests in IBD, liver cancer and nutrition. How did they come about?</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>Let’s go in reverse order. I came back and the boss said to me, “Well look by the way, I couldn't get all the sessions I needed for you, so I had to give you this nutrition session - you don't mind doing the intravenous nutrition for the hospital?” I thought, “What? I don't know anything about that!” Anyway, so I took on that and it's been a good way of getting to know surgeons and people across different silos. They're quite unusual, needy patients. It's quite tough but it's rewarding.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>As for the liver cancer side of things, we've always known that liver cancer has been increasing, and we just wanted to prove that it was more common than people thought. We had a fantastic liver fellow, Thai Hong, who's now one of the consultants here. Thai is pretty obsessed with Hep B, he’s very keen to make sure that this thing is highlighted. He did some fantastic research through the seven big hospitals in Melbourne looking at how many liver cancers there were and how they were tracked and showed that the incidence was about twice what it was thought to be. It worked because it was so fastidious and mythologically excellent. We got published in Hepatology, which was the premiere journal, so we’re pretty proud of that. That work has had ramifications. The Cancer Council changed the way they do things on the basis of Thai’s work.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Then the IBD stuff... I worked in liver things originally, and I did IBD when I went to England, because I couldn't find a liver job in London that wasn't a lab job. I thought I'll just do this IBD stuff, this looks like fun. I was lucky, I worked for a guy called Michael Kamm. He's one of the professors here now. It was the era of the anti-TNF antibody, with the first trial in Crohn's disease. We ran two big trials and probably had the most English patients in the trial. I came back to Australia with more anti-TNF experience than anyone in the country, and experience with these incredibly complex patients. That set me up really in the IBD world.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Then, because I'm a girl, I see lots of women. The first thing that happens when you make women well is that they want to have babies. Then randomly someone wrote to Michael Kamm said, “I've got a research fellow who wants to come.” But he couldn’t look after this person, so they came to me. Mette is my Danish research fellow, and she and I ended up doing this paper on babies who were exposed in utero to these anti TNF antibodies. We measured levels and their outcomes. It’s one of the studies that has shown it’s safe to take these drugs in pregnancy. The spin off is that I've got another fellow who's doing a PhD in that area now looking at other drugs. We run a pregnancy clinic here now, so that's become my ongoing research.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>I was wondering if you could comment on your experience of being a woman in medicine, the challenges you might have faced, or what you think is great about being a woman in medicine.</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>Well, I think women make good doctors, that's the first thing. Actually, there are some studies that show that, although they're not widely publicized. I don't think it's just because we're touchy-feely, caring. We are good at the whole spectrum of medicine. I think it's good to be a woman in medicine.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>It's not always easy to get past that moment where you have kids, because then obviously you've got competing demands on your time. It just takes a lot longer to do anything. The traditional career path of a man will pretty much always outstrip that of a woman at that moment. That's a bit frustrating because you essentially have the same skills as they do, but you don't quite get there. You become Deputy Director instead of Director, or you miss out on something because you've taken a few years out, or you get given the slightly boring jobs because they finish at 5:00pm and people think you're a bit of a flake for thinking about your children. It's quite subtle, most of the bias against women.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I mean I used to work slightly different hours so that I could pick up or drop off my kids, and people would ring you and say, “Where are you?” I'd say, “Well, I'm at pickup.” They’d think ‘What a flake. this woman is not even at work.’ But I'm answering your telephone call, just tell me what you want! Sometimes it’s irritating because you've got less time than the guys to do your stuff. They have the luxury of putting in an extra half an hour. Not that they think of it as a luxury, but it is luxury, whereas you have to leave because day care closes in five minutes and you will be fined if you don't pick up on time, or your nanny will resign, or whatever it is that you've arranged. I think that it just becomes logistically difficult.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>A lot of women are just grateful for what they're given in that circumstance and will not push the envelope. I think people get sick of it being a bit hard and they choose to make it less hard. They don't push through that period and hang around. They do often come back actually later, but it just takes a while. If you want an academic career, it's really difficult. I mean my colleague Barbara and I always call it the “mommy track”. There’s academic track and there's mommy track. Mommy track is the service track where you do all the work and somebody else gets the glory. If you're an ambitious person, then that's hard to rationalize. I think a lot of people give up their ambitions, or don't develop them when they could.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>Now back to your career, you’ve just been appointed in a new role as Head of Gastroenterology at Monash (Medical Centre). Can you tell us about how that came to be?</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I was Deputy Director here for about eight years, and then they changed it from a director position to a professor director position. This is an academic appointment at the university at the certain level. When it was advertised I did not have the academic qualifications to apply. One of my male colleagues, who's 10 years younger, did have the academic qualifications to apply but he did not have the management experience. In fact, he had no management experience at all. He applied and got the job. That was a really difficult career moment. I sat back and thought, ‘Now I have to work for someone who's younger than I am, who will outlast me here. What will I do?’ I could keep doing all my administrative stuff that I'd been doing for the previous guy, be the hand-maiden, while he's walking around being the professor, but instead I thought ‘You know what, I'm going to give this job back’. It was an unpaid position, extra to my normal job. I used the time to do research, that's where the pregnancy research came from.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>What that experience taught me is that men just go for it. Even if they don't have the skill set. Women think they have to have everything. I was told not to apply because I wouldn't get it, whereas if I had applied, I might have been in the running, maybe as an associate professor. Even if I hadn't got it, the experience of interviewing for it would've been helpful professionally. I think that was incorrect advice in retrospect. This time round when the directorship at Monash was advertised, I did have the qualifications, and so I have that job now, and I start on Monday.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>How do you balance the demands of a managerial or administrative role with obviously caring for your patients?</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I mean most people who are directors do about 50% clinical work and 50% administrative work. I do a day a week private practice and about 50% of the remaining time in clinical work. It will be the same at Monash. For the administrative stuff, I think you just have to be organized. You need a really good PA. This person is almost as important as your partner in making your life work. There's a reason that surgeons marry their secretary, it’s because they’re really important people and they see them all the time.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>People always think that admin is paperwork and boring shit. Yes, there is that, but I think what the administration offers is the ability to do the strategic planning work, to work out where the service is going, where the expansion should be going, and hopefully develop services that fulfil needs, and to change things. For instance, outpatients is done in the same way now as when I was a medical student, which is quite a long time ago. I mean, yes, now we have an EMR, that's probably the major change. Yes, we have a bit of tele-health, but not really. We haven't taken now that next leap. Part of that is a big picture problem, but part of that is that is has been driven by our suite of quite conservative practitioners who like the one-to-one. There's only so much you can do with one-to-one.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>There are other health services overseas where they do things differently, in a slightly more group or streamlined manner. You end up with the one-to-one, but you don't necessarily have to spend so much time. They have been forced to do that because of the sheer number of patients. I think it behoves us to look at those the ways people are doing it in those countries and look at what we could utilize. Hopefully that will be one of the things I’ll get to play with at Monash.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n        </Blog.TextBlock>\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\nimport { Blog } from '../../components';\n\nexport default function jonathan_king() {\n    return (\n        <Blog.TextBlock>\n            <Blog.Author>Interviewed and written by Sarah Jackson</Blog.Author>\n            ‍<br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>So if you think doctors have very translatable skills, do you think they are more able to start a business and be an entrepreneur than most?</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>No, I don't think that. I think that doctors though should never doubt themselves and they can achieve what they want if they put the time in. But anyone can do that. If you put in enough time and you learn and absorb enough, even if it takes months, you can learn what you're meant to do. At the end of the day if you have the means to surround yourself with the right people who are in that skill set, you can set yourself up well. They always talk in entrepreneurship never be the smartest person in the room. I'm very fortunate to surround myself with people who are much smarter than me, and this is how the company grows and can lead to progress. Really, I think being a doctor we actually have to work in teams a lot more than people expect or think of us. I think that we actually show points of leadership by handling delicate situations, communicating with the patient and their family; as well as the nurses and other surrounding staff. Don't underestimate yourself, because it does take leadership to do that. When people earlier on asked me, do you even know how to run a team? Actually we do, we actually run significantly large teams. Being able to be on call for a hospital with X number of beds is actually a lot more stressful than being a CEO or an operations manager!</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>How do you see the change that Lysn creates in the mental health sphere?</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>We see it in all our services, as people can give feedback afterwards. It's not as common as seeing someone day-to-day in the hospital and giving you feedback, but you might get an email thanking you or saying something like ‘I’ve been been looking for someone for nine months to get my partner to come to couples counsel. Now 18 months later there's no excuses because we can do it at home so easily at 9 p.m. at night”. Most of our services are after hours. Peak times are 2pm to 10pm. We really can provide services that fit people in the time of day that they need, so it's not like you're leaving work during the day to have to see someone. Clinicians don't want to be on call 24/7 either. How can we expect Sydney clinicians to be starting at 8 o'clock in the morning then staying up till 11 seeing patients? For us, facing this issue we thought: let's go to WA and recruit. We went over to WA and recruited 30 plus psychologists because that we knew that we could utilize their time difference in order to push our hours of service later. Using technology allows us to do things like that.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>How do you go about your days in the business world?</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>On a day to day we usually have a little team meeting in the morning, understanding what our goals are for the week. We usually have two meetings a week, so the whole team is on the same page and then individual people on the team have different roles. My head-of-clinical is psychologist and we work together very closely planning all the main meetings. We could have six meetings in a day. Some of them are on phone or online, some of them are in the city. We really try to structure it so we can go to meetings efficiently. We might be even be doing a phone meeting while we are in an Uber or Taxi to the next meeting. We've done that a few times! The meetings are all really different. Like if you're meeting tech developers, you could be being advised on how to implement security, wheras some meetings are purely business development. The last few weeks we've been focusing on business development, so we're meeting government agencies or clinics, and then going on to do training. Or we're meeting with lawyers to make sure that we have the contracts correctly written up. Entrepreneurship really will test every avenue of your brain or your skill set and make you learn more.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>How is Lysn founded? Do you get government funding?</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>Jonathan: Lysn was bootstrapped off my savings, then followed by selling my apartment, and now we continue to bootstrap off revenue. We are definitely going to have to get funding from investors, but that will be in due time. You have to really try to think as far as possible into the future, because the reality is when you're funding it yourself, you can direct your choices towards what you want to achieve. You can take on investors, but make sure that the investors are the right people who actually believe in your business, and not just trying to commercialize. Yes, the aim is to make it a sustainable business, but in healthcare it's not like you're selling a product or renting out your house. Your aim is to achieve certain outcomes. I think that sometimes can be lost. Really keeping bootstrapped and working tightly as a team has allowed us to not lose focus.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>What do you think of the mental health issues in the medical community itself, as a separate issue? Do you think that needs to be another service that's available to doctors, health workers and students as well?</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>We are about to launch a partnership which I can't talk about today. Very soon though, with a large medical organization doing junior doctor support. I think that there's a lot of factors in what's affecting doctors. Going through that, just the sheer hours you have to work, being on call, and never having downtime when you're on call. Let's say you are on call for sub specialty surgery for 72 hours. From Friday afternoon all the way until Monday morning, that can be very busy. I think there's a lot of stresses, and I think doctors and nurses are phenomenal people. You have to deal with the stresses of the health care system and constantly giving yourself and helping people all the time, and you may not really be getting that much self-care back. That's one of the things you have to deal with as a doctor, and I think there needs to be implementation of safety measures into the healthcare system for workers to protect doctors and other health professionals. The second thing is for doctors and for all health professionals to really understand their rights. I've spoken to both specialists and junior doctors, and some of them think that speaking to a psychologist or seeking help in that capacity means that the psychologist has to name and report them; and that's not the case. The case is, if you're potentially at risk of affecting a patient's care, then they have to report you. If you're just suffering from depression, anxiety or imposter syndrome, it’s a completely different story. For me in business especially I'm going through imposter syndrome all the time, wondering if I have the knowledge to get through this. I think you just have to understand that it is natural. You need to get help and support otherwise you'll continue to just wither, and those thoughts will inevitably prevent you from getting better.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n        </Blog.TextBlock>\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\nimport { Blog } from '../../components';\n\nexport default function helen_malcolm() {\n    return (\n        <Blog.TextBlock>\n            <Blog.Author>Interviewed and written by Jasmine Davis</Blog.Author>\n            ‍<br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>JIGSAW PUZZLE OF MEDICINE</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I studied science to start with, and worked in a museum in Melbourne for a while. I tried teaching. I didn't like that. One day I was coming home to Shepparton by train with a cousin who was looking for a job. She threw me the paper after she'd looked in the job ads and here was this ad for deputy director of an orphanage in Bangladesh. I just, applied and I was there for two years.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I was basically running the sick bay, and there was a local doctor on the island. It was a remote island in the middle of the Bay of Bengal. While I was there it made me think that I wanted it to be a doctor. As a Muslim country, Bangladesh did not allow the male doctor to examine the female patients, so he would take me with him. He'd sit in one side of the house and I'd be on the other side of a wall examining the patient with no idea what I was actually doing.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I just loved the jigsaw puzzle of that whole medicine thing, thinking how do I take this and this and this and put it all together to make a diagnosis.

Medicine is so physically orientated. We forget about the mental. We definitely forget about the spiritual. It's a really taboo area. Look I think all faiths really have what's called the golden rule, love your neighbour as yourself. It's just worded differently in different faiths.

In the past, when everybody automatically went to church, they would go to the priest, and tell things in total confidence knowing that nobody else would ever hear. Now because people don't go to church, I think they're missing that element of their lives. If they can find a GP who's not necessarily religious but has that same approach of being able to really listen to maintain confidentiality, I think the GP could be seen as the new priest.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>MENTAL HEALTH IN MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS AND MEDICAL SCHOOLS</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>When I came back from Tanzania the second time, I'd been there for a year and a half, and I suffered from depression.

To actually go through it and realize how devastating it is, made me a much, much, much better doctor.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I like to say to patients, look, it's just the same as a cold or a broken leg.

He thought it was a great opportunity and I could always swap out of it if I didn’t like it. I was convinced so I put medicine at Melbourne Uni as my first preference and I loved it.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>TORTUOUS PATHWAY IN MEDICINE</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I was living with my fiancée when I was doing the surgical rotation in my 2nd year after graduating. The days were long, so we were finding it difficult to see each other and had to have a chat about what was compatible with a long-term relationship. Then luckily, the 3rd rotation that I did in my 2nd year was ICU. The lights went on and I knew that that’s what I wanted to do.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I told my boss about that and he said I’d have to sit the physician’s exam, then they would take me back as a registrar, which meant I had to change from surgical to medical training. So I began ICU training via the physician’s stream after that and my boss sent me to Adelaide for an exam course which was run by a physician, an anaesthetist and an intensivist. I loved what the anaesthetic world brought to the critical care world, so I came back and said I wanted to do the anaesthesia exam which meant 3 more specialist exams. I had the opportunity to do a year of anaesthesia at the Women’s and Children’s hospitals, and another one to complete my anaesthetics specialty exams. I thought those opportunities would never normally occur in one’s lifetime, so I took them and completed that specialty qualification as well.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>GETTING INVOLVED WITH TEACHING</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I think all doctors are expected to teach. They teach patients and junior staff around them. So that morphed for me from sharing my thoughts with people around me to teaching courses. I gave tutorials during my advanced training for anaesthetic exam preparations. Then I got the opportunity to teach medical students, which gave me insight into a different part of education, when I had my first university appointment during my ICU job at St Vincent’s. I also became an examiner for Australasian colleges and was invited to become the Deputy Director and Chair of the exam committee, and that led to multiple appointments later. Then 11 years ago, a new job was created, which was a combined Director of Medical Education at RMH and Dean of the Clinical School at Melbourne University. It was too good not to apply for.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Part of what I love about teaching students is incredibly selfish. I just love the wonderful approach that most medical students have in their first clinical years. They’re passionate, idealistic, full of enthusiasm, and yet they’re a blank canvass. If I can contribute in some way to making them the best doctors that they can be, it is the most ridiculously rewarding job. I also get paid to do it which is quite strange!</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>KEEPING AN EYE OUT FOR OPPORTUNITIES</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>For the last 28 years, all my jobs had never existed before I took them. In my junior years of training, I was effectively choosing what I’d be doing on a yearly basis and planning a little bit for the future, but there was still a degree of uncertainty. So I continued to do the things that I thought would make me the best specialist that I could be, and then I was invited to do a few things along the way. It was looking back at my response to those invitations that made me realize that it’s important to tell people to look out for those sorts of opportunities. You must recognise that irrespective of what stage of your career you’re at, you’re not sure of what the future holds. So, I encourage people to explore their passions, to make sure they’re a broad human being, as well as an excellent clinician. Those other skills that you bring to the table can be extraordinarily valuable as you develop a working life and a specific career. We all think that we are going to be clinicians for the rest of our lives but we’re more than that. I never appreciated that as a student.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>A MESSAGE FOR THE JUNIORS</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I must admit that in the early days, I had no idea what I could achieve. If I had let that thought worry or control me, that might have paralysed me. But by being prepared, committed and working hard, I was given some wonderful opportunities and because of those opportunities, I’ve been able to contribute. I’d encourage people to recognise that sometimes there is no tangible reward to the hard work that they’re putting in, but it is all accumulating.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Text><i>Professor Peter Morley is the Director of Medical Education at the Royal Melbourne Hospital.</i></Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n        </Blog.TextBlock>\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\nimport { Blog } from '../../components';\n\nexport default function frank_oberklaid() {\n    return (\n        <Blog.TextBlock>\n            <Blog.Author>Interviewed and written by Avi Bart</Blog.Author>\n            ‍<br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Text><b>“You can’t be too arrogant as a paediatrician, because every now and then when you think you’ve got life handled a child will urinate on you, or vomit on you.

To the extent that I've had a reasonable career, it's not as if I planned for that. My advice always is to hang in there, live for the moment. It's a cliché, I know.

My world has been focused externally. My previous boss, a brilliant Harvard guy, said to me, “you've got a choice. You can either go home with an empty briefcase or go home with a full briefcase.” He said, “if you want to build a career, it’s not a 40 hour week.” That's true.

There's such a grey area in terms of there's no treatment, there’s only managing. There's the opportunity to really share yourself, to really be creative.

How can we build capacity in this family and community so they're better able to look after their kids? That's become my mantra and my philosophy. That's the philosophy of the Centre. All of our work has really been around working with community to try and stop kids getting sick. That was totally foreign when I first came back to Australia. I think its mainstream now.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>A lot of that work is invisible. It's hard from an advocacy point of view, and I think that's where the Centre has made a big contribution in starting to change the orientation away from treating you towards developing relationships that can help build your capacity to parent, and about going into communities. The question is what does this family, what does community need in order to sustain themselves? That's much harder. The future is not about more and more and more and more. It's about different, and different is a much more challenging way of working than asking for more.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>CONCLUDING REMARKS</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>‍We live in a complex world and there's a lot to be depressed about.

We have a high cost of living. If we had a commensurate high pay it would be a lot easier to get people here. Even people who are from here get paid sometimes twice or three times as much on the mainland. If they have high debts from medical school, they need to go there and make that money. Even if their family is here and they want to come home, they may not be able to afford to. We need them to come home. If they're working on the mainland, it's very hard to give up that income and come here where houses cost double. Not only is the cost of living higher, but the pay being lower makes it very difficult for us to recruit people. I even have some friends who are emergency doctors and they work in Arizona. They fly to Arizona to work and they come back here to live, because they make three or four times as much but they'd rather live here. I would say that would be the number one thing to do to increase our physician supply. You listed some other ones. Once people do move here, maybe their spouse can't find a job. Maybe their kids don't like the school systems. We have one school system. It's all one school district and then we have some private schools. What I've also seen a lot of lately is that folks here need to move back to the mainland to take care of their parents.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>What role do you still play in helping investigate and solve the physician shortage?</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>We took the idea through the legislature, that each doctor would pay $30 a year when they were licensed and it would go towards our survey, so we could do this research state-wide, on supply and demand of doctors. They have renewed that a couple times and have made it now a permanent thing. That way we have some money to do the research, but more importantly we're trying to find solutions and that's very challenging. That's why we got into the research in the first place. My colleague has since retired, and so I'm doing all the research now. What we do is we have a survey that doctors fill out voluntarily when they relicense, which gives us information every other year. If they don't fill it out completely, and in the intervening years, we call their offices. We will Google them. We have students, who do Googling and then we call the office and we say “is Dr. Jones working there? Full-time? Great thank you.” That way we confirm. Because we find that every year about 20% of the doctors change where they practice, leave the state, or retire.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>Did you decide in medical school that you want to make a difference in Hawaii?</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>In medical school, no. I had already decided in middle school I wanted to be an obstetrician because I had seen my brother being born. I remember thinking there was so much love there and I wanted to do that for a living. Then when I was in medical school, I did my obstetrics rotation and none of the women seemed that happy; however I had a mentor who was a family physician and he got to deliver babies, he got to do some surgeries, and he got to see patients from birth to death. In my fourth year I did a month of surgery and I said, put me on call every other night because that's what it was like in residency in surgery. Then I did a month of family medicine in the outpatient community health centre. I decided family medicine was for me because I could do minor surgeries, I could do obstetrics, I could do the full spectrum. And it gives you the best platform from which to make a real difference. So that's what I did. I practiced full spectrum family medicine for a number of years.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>In spite of all the difficulties in physician shortage, what keeps you going?

I care about the doctors and I keep going because I'm trying to make it better for them, but it's very challenging, frustrating even. We keep trying to create programs for them, whether it's recruiting students into the professions, or creating telehealth programs to reach more patients, or educational systems for practicing providers, or loan repayment; doing all these kinds of things. The latest is we're trying to create a young doctors club where young doctors can come together and have a fun evening, and connect and feel reinvested in their career. We're also trying to connect senior physicians who want to retire with young physicians who can take over their practices; things like that. We also try to empower physicians to be able to do more advocacy on their own behalf. To have more say in how they're paid, because right now they're just given a contract and must take it or leave it. It's very disempowering. There's a lot to change.‍</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>If you had a big billboard out there with anything on it, metaphorically speaking, what would you put on it?</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I think I would just put a smiley face, because I think one thing we can do for each other is just share a smile.

To begin with, can you just give us a bit of a brief overview of your career path to date, and how you got to be doing what you're doing today?</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>“Well, back in 1968 I found myself in first year medicine at Melbourne University, much to my surprise. I did my clinical work from St Vincent's, and then I was working at St Vincent's. I guess at the back of my mind was the idea that maybe I wanted to be a scientist rather than a clinician. I made this known to my superiors and before I knew it, I had a project and I applied for a scholarship, which I got. Even though I only wanted to try research for a year, I was tied up now to do a PhD, which was four years.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I did that at St Vincent's. It was interesting. Up to that stage I'd been doing general medicine, and this was on the endocrine topic studying diabetes, which I didn't particularly like as a trainee or general physician. I then discovered that really everything is interesting, and whatever you get into, it’s the science and the questions that you're trying to answer that is critical. Having done my PhD I really got the research bug and there was no doubt in my mind that I wanted to be a researcher, with a little bit of clinical interest. That's essentially what's defined my career. All throughout my career I've done half a day of clinical work and then the rest of the week has been research.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Following on my PhD, I did a post-doctoral fellowship lasting two and a half years in Switzerland, in Geneva. By that stage, I was married and had three children, which meant we were very poor. That went okay, and then we came back and I went to the Department of Medicine at Royal Melbourne Hospital, where I set up techniques to study glucose turnover. We were studying Type 2 diabetes essentially. I set up a technique to measure glucose kinetics during an oral glucose tolerance test, and then we also started work doing basic research in collaboration with others. In the end I was running a research unit that had both a basic science and clinical medicine component. We made quite a few transgenic and knockout mouse models of diabetes. Then increasingly we did some clinical work in diabetes. Then it occurred to me that really that diabetes was being driven by obesity. I started getting interested in obesity and we shifted our emphasis from diabetes to obesity, because if you conquer obesity, you've conquered Type 2 diabetes. Since I've retired from the university, I've come back to clinical medicine. Now that I can't do research, I'm now working four days a week as a doctor. I've gone back to my medical roots.”</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>2. In a nutshell, how would you explain, the physiology and neurobiology of obesity and what you found doing your research?</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>“Well, first of all, there's very good evidence that weight has a genetic basis both for diabetes and obesity. That has come from several studies in identical twins, both in terms of showing that identical twins are very much closer in weight than non-identical twins, and that identical twins are exactly the same in terms of degree of similarity, whether they reared together or reared apart. If you overfeed forcibly identical twins, some put on weight and some don't, but the twins track together. Then, finally, a study conducted in Denmark took 540 people who had been adopted as babies and divided them into four weight categories. Then they asked a question - is there similarity between these people and their biological mothers? The answer was yes. Statistical significance 0.0001. And there was a correlation with their biological fathers, a bit less, but it was still significant. What about the adoptive parents, who were the ones who fed them and brought them up? They found no relationship at all. That tells you that the environment is necessary, but not causative. The cause is the genes. The environment is the facilitating medium if you like.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I guess our most well-known study is the one that showed how weight is defended in a way that the body never gives up. I like to tell my patients, we all have 10 hormones in our blood that are made by the small bowel, by the pancreas and by fat. Of these ten, there's only one that makes us hungry – ghrelin - which is made in the stomach. In Japan they found that following weight loss the level of ghrelin went up. Then, it was discovered that leptin, the hormone from fat that suppresses hunger, following weight loss its levels dropped.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>We had shown in a study we did that cholecystokinin (CCK), which is one of the hormones from the upper gut that makes us feel full after we eat, actually goes down after weight loss. In that study, we also demonstrated that if the patient is ketotic, the CCK doesn't go down. That was interesting. Then we did our own study where we measured not only those three hormones, but the others as well, and found that they nearly all changed in a direction to make you more hungry - so the ghrelin increases, the others go down. Then we found that a year later that those changes were still there. Then in another study we did on the rate of weight loss, we followed the patients for three years. Even though they had regained most of the weight, the ghrelin was still higher and the leptin was still lower three years after weight loss. Now we know that these changes are long lasting. There's some evidence that some of the changes are still there six years after weight loss, including leptin. That to me says that these hormone changes are permanent until you regain the weight.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>That's then changed our practice, because patients need to be helped in maintaining weight loss. In most cases, not all cases, this involves having some medication as well as some lifestyle advice about being mindful about what you put on your plate, about exercising, about weighing yourself regularly. I tell my patients if you gain just a little bit, just two kilos, then you need to go back on the diet to lose it quickly. Because if you don't, then each time you see the patient, it may only be a kilo, but that tend to build up and after a few years, they're back to baseline.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Then we did this study on the right way to lose weight and disproved the myth that had always been taught that the quicker you lose it, the quicker you put it on. Not true. The regain was the same, but we found that the people that lost it more rapidly were more likely to succeed in weight loss because they had the ketogenetic diet. In between, we had discovered that ketones also prevent the rise in ghrelin. They have multiple effects to suppress hunger. Ketogenic diets are the way to go. They save the patient money by not needing to buy those expensive medications that suppress hunger.”</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>3. In your experience, what are some of the big myths that you wish people didn't believe about weight loss?</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>“Well, the myth that it's all due to lifestyle, that really makes me cross because then you blame the patient. If you're hungry, I think it's unreasonable to expect patients to not eat when they're surrounded by food. Yes, there are those who can maintain weight. I have a handful of them. Ultimately what happens is if you focus on your weight issue, you can overcome this hunger thing. The problem arises when something happens to your life, when you're distracted. Some unpleasant thing happens, and you become distracted. Your biology says, well, this is the time to get me back up there. It's a defence of weight. When we were hunter gatherers, this was what saved us. The fact that we didn't sit down, we went out and looked for food because the hunger was driving us.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>At the moment ketogenetic diets are all the rage, but people think they need to eat a lot of fat to become ketotic. It's not true. No. All you have to do is avoid carbohydrates. If you're trying to burn the patient's fat, it's illogical to me to feed the patient fat. Why not get them to burn their own fat? The problem is the body doesn't want to burn fat. The body wants to burn carbs. So, if you deprive the body of carbs then the body has to burn the fat.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>The ketogenic diet (for weight loss) is not long-term, because you don't expect the patient to avoid carbohydrates for the rest of their lives. What I do is I have them on the ketogenetic diet while they’re losing weight. The length of times you're on the diet depends how much they have to lose. Then we stop the ketogenic diet, and this is when I warn them about the increased hunger that will happen when they break to diet. So they're not ketogenic anymore during the maintenance phase and they can eat everything, but small portions. Here's where the problem arises. You tell them to have small portions and yet their hunger is increased. How is that going to work?”</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>4. A few years ago, your work was featured in ‘The Obesity Myth’ documentary series. What prompted, if anything, the creation of that series and what do you hope that viewers gained from it?</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>“Well, we didn't initiate a series. We were approached by the production company that SBS appointed to do a documentary on obesity, CJZ. They approached us and we agreed to do it. At the beginning I was a bit reluctant, thinking that we wouldn't get patients who'd be willing to expose themselves to the world like that. In the end we agreed because this was a big chance to fight that myth that's unfortunately still out there, that obesity is the fault of the individual. We agreed, and then to my surprise, there were no shortage of patients who were willing to share their experiences, which was fantastic. Of course, we never gave the production company the names of patients. What we did was we talked to the patients about the program, and then asked them if they’d be interested. We gave the contact details of the production company to those that said that they were, and then the patient rang the company.  Otherwise it wouldn't have been ethical.”</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>5. What do you think it takes to find that perfect niche within medicine, when there are so many possibilities? How did you find yours?</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>“Normally I would have said go and follow your gut instinct. I fell into diabetes by accident. When I was registrar at St Vincent’s, the medical registrar was in charge of the newly formed endocrine ward. I had a first-year intern and a second-year resident under me, and I remember distinctly saying to the resident, “I’ll do the ward round with the intern to see the general medicine patients, and it's your job to take care of the people with diabetes because I'm not interested in diabetes… Famous last words. If you'd have told me that day that I was going to spend the rest of my life researching diabetes and its causes, I would have told you, you were crazy.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>So, it doesn't really matter, in a sense, if it's not just your gut feeling. You've got to like the subject you're doing. I personally have never been good with my hands. There was absolutely no doubt whatsoever in my mind that I was going to be a physician and not a surgeon. On the other hand, there are people that really liked tinkering with stuff, who would be much better off being surgeons rather than physicians. You've got to look at your own likes and dislikes and passions to then guide you into where you go. All I can say is that, if you've got an inquiring mind, it doesn't really matter which field of medicine you go into, they're all interesting. I'm sorry now I didn't do neurology, because the brain is such a fantastic machine. I would love to have been a neurologist. I also like kidneys. I like it all. I nearly became a haematologist.

I remember feeling very energised, and thinking ‘I’ve really arrived and I’m starting to enjoy all of this’. After being a junior doctor at St. Vincents for a couple of years, I had started the physician training program and had even taken a small role in organising some of the early lectures and tutorials.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Three lectures in however, I found myself bored to tears. The biggest leap of faith for me was coming home and having a discussion with my wife Carolyn, “Look I don’t even know if I want to be a physician. I go to lectures but we’re talking about big gastrin, little gastrin; I’m looking over the rooftops of Fitzroy, at the people walking past.”</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>The part of being a doctor I liked the most was seeing people off the street in the emergency department with undifferentiated presentations and trying to work it all out. I had to break the news to my physician boss and some of my mentors; it was a leap to tell them “I think I’m going to go into general practice.”</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I then did a diploma in obstetrics and gynaecology for six months down at Moorabin, and applied for fellowship at the College of General Practice. I went into general practice in 1978 after doing a few locums here and there. Choosing general practice is the best decision I ever made in my life. Carolyn’s inside - she would say it’s my second best decision.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I think that when you get a calling to do something, when you get a sense of what you are really going to enjoy, you are better off following that rather than preconceived ideas about what you think you ought to do.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>FROM DOCTOR TO AUTHOR, RADIO GUEST AND COLUMNIST</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>After about five years in general practice, I sat down one day and asked myself: what are the most important things I have learned? I made a list of my answers: recognising people who are ill, treating common conditions well, referring appropriately and health promotion - especially getting people to take more responsibility for their own health.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I worked for another five years and then the penny dropped. At this stage we had a couple of little kids, and I enjoyed telling them little stories that I had made up in my head. I realised we could start talking about health to school age kids. I came to the conclusion that if we are really going to be serious about making a difference in health, it’s all about education and we should be talking to kids from a very young age on looking after their own health, and the importance of diet and exercise.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>At that stage I wrote the Doctor Toby books. To my surprise publishers in Australia and overseas became very interested in them. The nine Doctor Toby books came into being - Nick has tonsillitis, Claire has an ear infection, Ahmed goes to hospital, etc. Invariably when you write books, you find yourself on an interview circuit. I was interviewed by people all around the country about the Doctor Toby books and why I wrote them. I talked about the importance of health education and making a trip to the doctor less frightening for little children.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>And then Neil Mitchell’s producer Steve Price approached me and said ‘I’d like you to do the occasional interview for us.’ I agreed to it. What he didn’t tell me was that they had a weekly talkback segment in mind. I ended up being a regular in the booth with Neil Mitchell on Melbourne’s leading talkback show, talking about health topics like high blood pressure or cardiovascular disease. It was a popular segment, and I did it for about four years.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>While I was doing that The Age came along and said, we’d like you to do a weekly medical article on the stuff you talk about on your talkback show. I had to say to Neil and his producers, ‘look I can’t do everything, but this is another challenge. I’ll do that though.” I did a weekly segment for the The Age and it was great fun. Then came some more books including The M Factor - Men and their health.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>As you go through life, it's a bit like playing football. All of a sudden the ball lands in your hands, and you can either hand pass it, drop it, or put it under your arm, take a couple of bounces, and go for a run with it. That’s what I did in each of these situations. I found that it was exciting to get outside of your comfort zone. It presented me with some really interesting challenges, and it’s extraordinary how many people I met through publishing, radio and writing.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>It is very satisfying to get involved in all these other activities and it opens up a lot of doors.

I found those areas through breaking down what I like about medicine. I like the helping people part. For me, that also meant helping doctors and medical students mental health. Then as a personality type, I've always been a joiner. I like to join organizations. I like to be part of things, which suggests a little bit about why I worked with AMSA, the AMA and the defence force. If you want to do big things, and you want to do things that are unusual, you need to have some backing to do that because individuals rarely achieve significant outcomes on their own.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>BECOMING A GP</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>In medical school I wanted to be a cardiothoracic surgeon. However, there's a couple of things that I learned along the way. One was that I had broad and varied interests. Those were difficult to fit with an intense surgical career. Surgical specialties are designed around such deep technical mastery that you really need to give all of yourself to them to be good at what you do.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>It's a long road from wanting to do cardiothoracic surgery to ending up as a GP. The takeaway I think is that, I allowed what I was interested in to shape what I did. Being honest with myself and asking: “is this what I want to do for the next 30 or 40 years of my life?” was a useful tool to finding a career in general practice. I enjoy being a GP. I really like talking to people. I love ongoing patient narrative and having the opportunity to consistently and incrementally influence behaviour. Also I know that if I want to transition into doing other things, general practice offers me a lot of breadth.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>INSPIRED ADVENTURES</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I've always liked the outdoors. To combine what used to be a really exciting part of my life in the defence force, with skills that I learned in my medical training, to then work in wilderness medicine ended up being a pretty natural fit. Certainly one of the reasons why I've ended up in my role as Chief Medical Officer at Inspired Adventures has been because I have this broad set of skills. Skills especially around risk management, understanding issues in foreign healthcare and experience interacting with local health services – all of which I gained through my work with the defence force.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>WORKING IN THE TECH INDUSTRY</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I joined as DermaSensor’s third employee. We've grown a lot over the last few years. Big organisations are probably a bit slow to come to see the possibilities in artificial intelligence, machine learning and medical devices. In my opinion we're nowhere near understanding the full impact of what can be done by AI in healthcare.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I was very much trading on my own reputation as an doctor to then go and work in the tech industry. Some people will say that those two things can never meet. My view is that they can. You have to be a strong advocate for ethical behaviour in a corporate setting. You often have the opportunity to drive a company to be better.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>TAKING TIME OUT</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I think there is an awful lot more pressure try to do things faster, sooner, better. I have taken time out of clinical practice at a few different points in my clinical career. Some of that has been to travel or climb (literal) mountains. Six months away after four or five years is actually hugely valuable. You come back with a renewed vigour for what you do, and so long as you take the time to do something meaningful with it, I don't think that time is ever wasted.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>HANGING ONTO PASSIONS OUTSIDE OF MEDICINE</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>Medicine is a wonderful career. It's exciting. Its broad, it's interesting, but it can be all consuming. You need to make a conscious effort to hang onto things. We often can't put our finger on why we gave things up, things just fall by the wayside. Carving time out for ourselves and our own passions is really important, because they are what really define us.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I'm certain if anyone was to write my eulogy it would include the fact I was a doctor, but hopefully would also include the fact that I liked other things.

Some of them were very inspirational figures, like Wu Lien-teh who was the first man of Chinese heritage to study Western medicine at Emmanuel College at Cambridge University. He went on to become well known in China as the plague fighter in the early 1900s.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>At the time he was really revered by his family and Chinese society for becoming a doctor - it was seen as an amazing achievement. So he was able to enact a lot of changes as an individual. When he was commissioned by the Foreign Office in Beijing to investigate a mysterious epidemic that turned out to the plague, he insisted that all the victims be cremated to stop the epidemic. This was cultural blasphemy at the time, but he managed to get his views through to the government and that was the end of the plague in China.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>HOW BEING A DOCTOR HAS CHANGED OVER THE LAST CENTURY</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>In those times you could be a one-person doctor. You could make laws as an individuals and people would take your word for it out of sheer respect. Being a doctor nowadays is completely different. Doctors are now part of the technician team and have lost a lot of their independence. Managers have come in and have said that doctors don’t know anything about money. Which is not true.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Everything is now about money. In your hospital they will say ‘I’m so sorry you can’t have that machine because we have no money.” I would have thought that it was the patient that is paramount. The reason we do medicine is because of the patients: we are their advocate when they have no voice. We want to make sure that everything we do is to benefit the patient. I say these things to you because I hope to inspire you and your generation to understand that there’s more to medicine than money or being the technician.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>If we had to give medicine a report card on how it has progressed through the decades, certainly there has been improvement in the medical science side of things. But on the human side - the way we treat our colleagues, how we advocate for the patients, the way medical administrations treats the people under them - I think we have actually gone backwards. I have in mind the recent story of Yumiko Kadota and her toxic working environment as an unaccredited plastic surgery registrar.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>It is not the fault of any one person, but we require everyone or many people to believe that this is not the right way to be. The way to change things is to get close enough to the top to change it at a government or policy level. Doctors need to get on the committees and boards, and when they get there they mustn’t change their tune. Some senior doctors I know are no longer the same person they were when they were fighting to get to the top to help the juniors.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>You’ve got to be like Sir Thomas More in A Man for All Seasons. Do the right thing, always remember what the right thing is, and continue to do that no matter how hard it is. If you don’t succeed the first time keep trying because if you hang around long enough, it will work out. That’s the secret. Winston Churchill once said that success is going from failure to failure without losing your enthusiasm. Remember that.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>PARALLEL CAREERS IN MEDICINE AND MUSIC</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>Unlike a few others who did medicine and then decided to transition into healthcare IT, I’m slightly different because I have purely parallel careers that have very few points of intersection. Although admittedly I have had GPs who have referred me high-functioning autistic children for music lessons.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Having both careers has been really good. Sometimes medicine may not act as a friend and there will be things stacked up against you. If you have another career on the side, the troubles you have in medicine will not seem as threatening.

You can go to your other career, forget about your other career temporarily, come back to it, and the situation will have changed</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>What you may not know is that I have had to hide my music career. I couldn’t let anybody know that I did music and it never appeared on my CV. It appeared on my CV much later on. Because you see, if it was known that I had another source of income, they (the hospitals) might not have employed me. They would have seen it as a lack of dedication to medicine.

What was the downside if it hadn't worked out for me? If I would have left for a couple of years and if it all went to hell I would have just returned to medicine. The bigger risk was staying in medicine all the way through without ever stepping off that conveyor belt to try something different. Maybe when you come back your friends will be “ahead of you” but you can pick it up again and get back into it. When you are 40 there will be no difference. Don’t overthink it.

Number two, stay in medicine: there are not many better ways to reliably make money. Find the thing you’re passionate about and go and meet people. Go talk to people and read everything that you can to so that you can understand how to avoid the obvious mistakes, and ideally find a partner.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>WERE THE SKILLS TRANSFERABLE?</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>Even if there were no transferable skills, I would still answer yes because I couldn’t live with the concept of having wasted six years.

I think that is super helpful in all facets of life.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>The other thing is that once you’ve worked in an emergency department, and have deal with high-pressure life-and-death situations, you realise nothing is all that important, stressful or overwhelming.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Lastly, when you understand medicine you understand how science works.

They know that you as a doctor are completely committed to solving their life-and-death problem. That is an entirely unique relationship. That I miss. I just can’t replicate it anywhere else.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>PROBLEMS WITH MEDICINE</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>My guiding principle in carving out a life for myself is - “how can I make my Monday mornings feel as good as my Sunday mornings?” I didn't achieve that when I was a medical student or young doctor.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>One of the problems with medicine is that we just don't acknowledge the inherent uncertainty, especially not to patients. If you set up a continuum from nothing to everything, in medicine what we know is closer to nothing than everything. You get much smarter after you are prepared to admit that there is a heap of stuff you don’t know.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Work-life balance is another issue but it is getting better. The next generation support one another and acknowledge that they don't have to be superheroes. When I went through medical school there was still an attitude of working 120-hour fortnights with no weekend. Senior doctors would say “we went through it, that's the rite of passage. It's not going to kill you”. The truth is it might.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>CLOSING REMARKS</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>One of the problems with medicine is that everything is about tomorrow. Suffer pain today for happiness tomorrow – but it's easy to never find that happiness. It's easy to say medical school is hell. You go through the hell because you're going to be a junior doctor, then a junior specialist, and then a senior specialist. But a lot of that is hell as well! You can find happiness at all points in the journey if you bother taking the time to look for it, and refuse to do an endless number of things on the sole basis that they will make tomorrow better.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>People think it’s a race to the top of the ladder. But what is really at the top of the ladder? You just fall off - there’s nothing special at the top of the ladder. I think the rungs are what’s interesting. There is no race up the rungs. If it doesn’t feel special and that feeling persists, then reappraise your life. You can also get off that ladder and do something else. People say - stop and smell the roses. I thought that was terrible advice because I was the typical type A personality. What I realised much later in life, it was actually pretty good advice.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n        </Blog.TextBlock>\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\nimport { Blog } from '../../components';\n\nexport default function louise_teo() {\n    return (\n        <Blog.TextBlock>\n            <Blog.Author>Interviewed and written by Jefferson Tang</Blog.Author>\n            ‍<br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Text><i>Dr. Louise Teo is a physician trainee and Founder of The Medical Startup, an online platform that shares inspirational stories of healthcare professionals pursuing medical innovation and creative careers.

I got into the physician training pathway straight after internship in Melbourne. While I was studying for exams a lot of things happened in my personal life. I continued to study anyway thinking that it would be a good distraction from what was going on. I didn’t pass the first time and I didn’t pass off the second time either. The first time was okay - people were more sympathetic. The second time was very different. I realised that I really needed a break and that it would be better for my mental health and wellbeing.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>It was a difficult decision to make as the general feeling communicated by senior hospital staff was that I would never be accepted into a trainee position again if I took a break from physician training. This pressure to never take a break, coupled with the many stresses that I saw my colleagues go through - even the ones who had passed exams - really reinforced the depressing feeling of being another cog in the system. It’s common for trainees to feel that there’s no space to breathe and that specialty training is all that there is to life.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I decided to to take a break to do what I had wanted to do for a long time - to locum all around Australia. It took a little over a year to stop feeling that I had to be studying in my spare time and to stop fretting over what I would do the next year. Instead I trained myself to enjoy life, to be present in the moment, and to do things that personally mattered to me on my own terms - and not what the college or hospital expected.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>EXPLORING FASHION AND APP DEVELOPMENT</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>When I failed my physician exams the first time I went to South Africa for a holiday with my partner and some friends. It was a spur of the moment decision. They had already planned the trip and were leaving in three weeks, but my partner who I had just started dating at the time asked “Do you want to come with us?” I answered, “I barely know you but okay sure I’ll go to Africa.”</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>It was great fun - we went out on safari and saw a lot of nature. It was really refreshing to be away from the medical world. On the trip I got an idea for a fashion design company - this was weird for me because I had never before thought in my life that I would be in the fashion industry.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>At the same time I had an idea for a non-medical app and I started reading up  a lot on app development. I don’t have a fashion company or app yet and that’s fine for me. It’s more that these topics sparked an intense curiosity for me to learn all that I could about them. It was really exciting and gave me a much needed breathe of fresh air outside of medicine when I really needed it.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>STARTING THE MEDICAL STARTUP</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>All these random pursuits led me to realise one night on a locum rotation - “I like writing. I want to explore all these different careers. I want to meet people who have pursued these alternative tracks and write their stories. I think I’ll start a blog and put all these interviews together.” Back then no one talked much about alternative career pathways where people combined non-medical pursuits with their medical career, or branched out entirely. I started interviewing people about three years ago in 2016. I would fly around while doing locum rotations and meet people on stopovers. I blogged my interviews prolifically on The Medical Startup and to my surprise it took off.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>ADVICE FOR THE JUNIORS</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>Don’t get intimidated when people ask you “what do you want to do later on?” If you don’t know what you want to do then that’s also okay. You don’t need to have a five-year plan. Don’t get so fixated on one path that you lose focus on everything else in your life. You forget to eat and drink. You forget to go to the gym. You forget to see your family. You forget to have a life. You don’t have to have it all figured out right away. Most people that I know have changed career paths or specialties at least once. I’ve met a lot of surgical people who have moved into GP or pathology. I’ve also met people who have done a Masters in a non-medical field, and one person who went to film school. It’s all a process of trying things out, and realising over time what works and what doesn’t work for you.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n        </Blog.TextBlock>\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\nimport { Blog } from '../../components';\n\nexport default function jim_black() {\n    return (\n        <Blog.TextBlock>\n            <Blog.Author>Interviewed and written by James O'Donnell</Blog.Author>\n            ‍<br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Text><i>Associate Professor Jim Black is a public health physician and global health expert with extensive and diverse career experiences ranging from working as a clinician in Mozambique to leading the epidemiology department in the Victorian Infectious Diseases Service (VIDS) at RMH.

I really believe that health is more than just the absence of disease.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>One of my early influences and mentors was Ken Newell, who at one point headed a division of the World Health Organization. I really like the way he put it in a book he edited - “Health by the People” - where he put forward the argument that nobody would define success as the absence of failure, so we should not define good health as the absence of disease.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>If you have read Anna Karenina by Tolstoy, there is a very famous sentence: “Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” I think the inverse is true when it comes to health - good health is something unique and different for every individual, whereas people with diseases tend to resemble each other. It’s much easier to learn about diseases, then it is to learn about individuals and what constitutes good health.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>If you start thinking of yourself as a health worker rather than as a treater or even preventer of diseases, then that opens up all sorts of possibilities. A medical degree is a good start, but it tends to focus on disease. Defining myself as a health worker means that I can spend the day welding the frame for a new prototype oxygen storage chamber and still feel like I’m a health worker.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>PREPARING FOR DISEASE OUTBREAKS IN RESOURCE-LIMITED SETTINGS</Blog.Subtitle>\n            ‍<br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Text><i><b>Mozambique - 1998 Cholera Outbreak</b></i></Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>We did it right with the 1998 cholera outbreak in Mozambique. There were cholera outbreaks in neighbouring countries and in the south of the country long before it got to us. We had more than enough time to stockpile equipment to prepare a ‘Kit 30’ and ‘Kit 300’ - little medical kits that were enough to treat the 30 and 300 patients respectively. They fit in the back of a LandCruiser, the other on a small truck, which meant that we could quickly send out an anti-cholera response to any health facility in the province.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>We worked out that the cholera was likely to come first to the provincial capital, so we designated the old nurse’s quarters as the cholera ward. We worked out a roster appointing everyone’s individual duties, we stockpiled swimming pool chlorine, and we had Mozambican Red Cross volunteers all ready to get their hands dirty.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>The first case was diagnosed at 6:00AM on a Friday. We opened the cholera ward at 9:00AM on the same day. By midday on the Saturday the Red Cross volunteers were going house to house in the affected area chlorinating household water stores.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>During the nine weeks of the outbreak, we had the lowest incidence and fatality rate in the country. My colleagues liked to tell me “Well you were lucky!” We didn’t like thinking about it that way, we like to think we were prepared!</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Text><i><b>East Timor - A New Nation</b></i></Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I came back from Mozambique thinking that I needed to do something more detailed - more for my own sake than anything else. So I started a PhD on disease surveillance at Monash. I was looking at some interesting statistical methods including an artificial intelligence concept called artificial neural networks.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>In the midst of that arose an opportunity to go to East Timor. As you may know, in August 1999 the then Indonesian president gave the people of East Timor a vote for independence. The vast majority of them voted to leave and become an independent country, so the Indonesian military torched East Timor down and destroyed 95% of the infrastructure. Following that a UN sanction military force - mostly Australians - came in and ran the country for about two years until East Timor gained formal independence.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I arrived in November of 1999 as the senior epidemiologist for the World Health Organization, responsible for disease surveillance and outbreak preparedness. There was a sense that the role of us outsiders was to ‘keep the patient alive’ - as East Timor had been seemingly devastated by the departure of the Indonesians. Some of us believed though, that there were people around who could form a successful sovereign government. It was our job to find and help them. We were keen to see Timor’s people take charge of their own destiny.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Ultimately if we are helping to create a new independent country, we need to be designing the systems and structures that allow the country to function autonomously. I like to think of the three S’s: systems, structures and sovereignty. We created systems for disease surveillance that empowered us to monitor diseases with outbreak potential. We created structures through which a new Timorese government would be able to modify and run those systems. And the underlying reason for all of this is sovereignty: in creating a sovereign state, the people from that state ought to be in charge as soon as possible.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>FREO₂ - APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGY OXYGEN CONCENTRATORS TO TACKLE PREVENTABLE PNEUMONIA DEATHS</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>Pneumonia is actually the biggest cause of death in children under five. There unfortunately isn’t a straightforward way to tackle it.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>At the Nossal Institute for Global Health we ran a little symposium called the “No Limits” symposium. An audience of scientists and engineers listened to presentations by clinicians and the healthcare problems they take on.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Dr. Trevor Duke, Australia’s leading pneumonia expert, gave a really interesting talk on oxygen concentrators as therapy for pneumonia, and how they have huge therapeutic potential but are limited by low power availability in resource-limited settings. The physicists in the audience picked up on that and from that came a range of innovations, including the FREO₂ Siphon electricity-free concentrator and the FREO₂ Low Pressure Oxygen Storage (LPOS) system.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>FREO₂ has since grown into quite a large program in Australia - it is a non-for-profit that is driven by the belief that “every health facility that cares for in-patients should have a reliable supply of oxygen.” A deceptively simple concept that actually needs a major paradigm shift in the coming years.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>ADVICE TO BUDDING YOUNG MEDICAL STUDENTS</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>Don’t worry if what looked like the perfect path turned out not to be.

You've got to squeeze every last drop out of every opportunity that you have to make a difference.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I have got friends who are doctors who have done very well in a material and professional sense. Some of them are very miserable and unhappy people. My assessment is that they stuck around in medicine for the wrong reasons. If you personally feel that you’re on the wrong tram, you need to get off. One of the things I’ve learned over the years is that you must take risks.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I was the first member of our family to go to university. You can imagine how my parents felt when, after school I was accepted to study Economics. And then how they must have felt when I announced I was leaving and had no idea what I was going to do. They were  just absolutely devastated. Then again after I studied medicine, got on the paediatrics specialist training program, and then made the decision to leave the program. And after that, to give up medicine altogether - a respectable profession that I trained so hard for - to go into politics. At each point you've got to reassess. If you don't feel entirely fulfilled with what you're doing, then you must really think about it.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>ON POWER</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>When I was a GP, there were several MPs that were building a career for themselves on what I saw as the denigration of the medical profession. I was angry about this. The AMA wasn't doing anything about it. In fact, I felt that the AMA was a big part of the problem. I decided to get active with the AMA to fix it. Having got involved perhaps for the wrong reasons, I then realised how power can be used to realise the aspirations and convey the voices of people that don’t have any.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I took the AMA into a broad spectrum of social issues, using the profession’s influence to advocate for issues as diverse as environmental health and tobacco control. For example, we led a campaigns against tobacco advertising and sport sponsorships, the debates around euthanasia and illicit drug use, and a campaign against the prohibition of homosexual acts in Tasmania.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Regarding Aboriginal health, I put enormous effort into getting the existential challenges of Aboriginal people into middle-class lounge rooms and everyday life discussions.

As I understand it there are already 300 people, all experts, working at the Australian War Memorial. But I have learned something about experts from my time in the medical profession and through everything I've done since. Experts see the world through a straw. This job will not only involve managing the memorial, but also be a leader and ambassador for it. I've been in the situation before, and the key task is to apply intellectual rigour to the process of exercising judgment on behalf of the institution and drawing on all of the expertise both within it and outside”.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>ON MAKING A DIFFERENCE</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>You've got to nurture and protect your idealism. You can't ever abandon it. You should never stop believing that you can make a difference, whether it’s in a small or large way. You have to accept that you can’t do everything. Life, and certainly politics, is to varying degrees an art of compromise.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Some people lead from positions of authority – the chairman of a board for example. Others lead from principle. The key is to become a person that can lead from both position and principle. In order to do that, you need to have a clear sense of who you are, of your own ideals, and the lines over which you will not cross. You also need the capacity to inspire people to rise above themselves to support the broader vision that you have for the organisation that you're seeking to lead.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Another key to it is that you've got to realise that you can't achieve anything on your own. You will only ever get something done if other people share your vision and enthusiasm for your particular cause. You have got to accept that the people you bring with you will often think differently.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>FITTING EVERYTHING IN</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I really don’t know the answer to that and anyone that says they do might have found their own solution. I don't know however know if there's a single, simple template that works for everybody. I think your family does suffer and make involuntary sacrifices no matter which arena you pursue - whether it’s in medicine or politics.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>You reach a point where you have just got to say no. Whether it's no to accepting more hours of work, or you have just got to accept the fact that you can't spend another three hours studying that particular night. You actually have to block out time well in advance to spend time with the important people in your life.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>The other thing that is really important is making time for yourself and your passions. In my case I like fishing and motorbikes. You need time to think and reflect. When I was in politics, I spent a lot of time on planes before there was in-flight Wi-Fi. I used to love it because I could spend the entire flight thinking or reading.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>It’s also important to spend time, even if it’s just 10 or 15 minutes a day, reading about something that has got nothing to do with your direct day-to-day work. As I said before - you don’t realise what you’re learning while you’re learning it.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>REGRETS</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>No - I don’t think I have any regrets. I put 100% into everything I do, and when I finish, I finish. There's no point going through life saying “What if?”. It consumes people in a negative way. It’s not the things you do in life that you regret, it’s the things you don’t do. If you have a niggling in your own mind, for example you're training to be a general physician but in your own heart you’re wondering if you should be doing psychiatry or indeed leaving medicine altogether to do something else, you will regret it if you don’t follow your personal gut feelings.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>CONCLUDING REMARKS</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>My Jesuit education taught me that a life of value would be built on four things.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>The first is commitment. Keep at whatever you believe in. Don’t give up.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>The second is conscience. Every single decision you make should be critiqued by the question - What is the right thing to do? There is no such thing as a big or small decision. Every decision you make has consequences for yourself and for others.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>The third is compassion. Compassion is about being imbued with the imaginative capacity to see the world through the eyes of others.

I was working as a doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children in Sydney and saw the first death from whooping cough in 20 years. It was directly related to a TV show segment about vaccines. They didn't care whether it was true or not, all they cared about was selling dog food through ads. Advertisements, that’s what’s important, and they don’t care so long as they make lots of sales. The baby died and I was at the kid’s hospital when it happened. This was totally unnecessary. The baby did not have to die. So I decided to get out of normal medicine and move to communication. Although being a doctor in a kid’s hospital was the best job I have ever had, I realised I could do more good educating the public on the benefits of science and modern medicine.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>ON BALANCE ⚖️</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>One thing I realized early on is the people who cry most at your funeral are your family.

They're not perfect and they don't work for everybody. Probably personalizing it is important, for example with cancer treatment, usually it is done on a biological basis and subtype people or stage people. Currently, there's a lot of research going on staging mental disorders like cancer. For example, the health practitioner can consider trans magnetic stimulation (TMS) at stage four whereas they can think about support and education at stage on and cognitive behavourial therapy (CBT) and antidepressants at stage three.  You can tailor treatment in mental health because every human being has had a different life and can personalize it around that person's life experience. Also, If you develop a positive therapeutic relationship that explains 60% of the benefit.. That whole expertise has got to be respected more.

Its why I came up with the staging idea. Because it allows you to have more flexible symptom clusters if you like in the early stages. Which don't have to be shoehorned into a category like depression or schizophrenia and there is a need for care when people have just got symptoms even before they've got the whole syndrome of some sort. A lot of people come to Headspace and I see there, they don't ask about what their diagnosis is. They just want help.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>‍What are some of the main challenges that remain translating research into practice?</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>‍That’s a great question, because this is a big problem in mental health. It about 14 years to get research it to the frontline of practice in mental health. None of that's true in areas like cancer. As soon as new cancer drugs develop, people can't wait to fund it to make it available. In mental health, even the things that we've discovered through research, are not available to people routinely. The vocational intervention program showed good evidence that it helps people recover but patients cannot access in most services. There's no funding stream to support that. A drug called clozapine, an antipsychotic, responds brilliantly to a third of patients but it has some risk as it may cause agranulocytosis. But if you monitor the white cell count on a regular basis, it's perfectly safe. The health system either can't be bothered or isn't resourced well enough to provide that extra time and care that's needed. So clozapine is not offered to patients or given later in treatment. Even when you go to the trouble of developing new models or new interventions, they're not funded or translated by government into the real world. Can you imagine if say two thirds of the people with breast cancer in Australia didn't get access to care? That's the situation with mental illness.‍</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>Do you have any rewarding experiences from patients as a doctor? ‍</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>This is one boy that I can think of. He was an epic patient about 10 years and he was a student at Melbourne University. He had mixed manic and psychotic symptoms, but he refused to receive treatment. When he realised that it was a major problem for him, he got adequate treatment and recovered well. He went back to university and became a doctor and he now works in IT. He could have ended up very bad, homeless and disabled way if we hadn’t treated him effectively. There are heaps of people coming through Headspace with sub type psychosis that recovered better from having identified earlier and did developed into a major psychotic illness. If they have a long going vulnerability like people have with asthma, they can manage it and still have a good life. The problem is, after a couple of years, we must discharge these patients back to the standard mental health system where they last for about five minutes and send back to the GP and they deteriorate. It's like we put all this effort to getting people well, and there's no effort made to keep them well.

That was the day I decided I wanted to be an anaesthetist.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>THE BEGINNING OF THE JOURNAL OF MOBILE TECHNOLOGY IN MEDICINE</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>One of my good friends, Chandra, was having trouble submitting to journals.

I was in Bairnsdale, and being a keen intern, I showed up to ED early before orientation had started. They told me to try picking up a patient just to get used to the paperwork since I was new. So I went to see a patient who had abdominal pain and was nauseated. I couldn’t even remember the names of maxolon and ondansetron. I remember telling the nurse to give the drug that sounded like a transformer robot, so she said, ondansetron? I was like yes! Then that didn’t work, so I told her to give her its arch nemesis, meaning maxolon. As I figured out the dose, the patient arrested and died. That was the beginning of my medical career. There was dead silence for the rest of the orientation. By the end of the day, I was getting texts from unknown numbers in Swan Hill asking me if I was okay, and I was like, “who are you?”.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>A MESSAGE TO MEDICAL STUDENTS AND JUNIOR DOCTORS</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>One of the benefits of medicine is that you don’t ever get an existential crisis about whether or not what you're doing is worthwhile. You’re always helping people, although we undersell that element now. You should keep in mind that what you’re doing has real human benefit, otherwise it’s easy to get jaded with exams and tough rotations when they happen. The other thing I would recommend is to try and not let medicine be everything in your life. There was a TED talk that explained how this generation was not expected to have just one career for their entire life. You change about 6 times, but instead of doing them all at the same time, do them in series, not in parallel. Keep that in mind especially when you start to get more opportunities later in your career, you’ll want to do them all but it’s ok to pick just one.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>‍BILLBOARD MESSAGE</Blog.Subtitle>‍\n            <Blog.Text>I’d say remember that you’re mortal. It might be the opposite of what I was saying earlier, but don’t procrastinate. There’s a balance between being too relaxed and too intense, and you should always try to have a middle ground. The other thing is that we forget is that time is limited, so not only go do stuff, but also appreciate the little moments, whether that’s coffee, your family or friends. Remember that these things won’t always last and that you won’t always be around. Also, in the cosmic scale of things, none of what you’re doing is epically important, so don’t take yourself too seriously!</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n        </Blog.TextBlock>\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\nimport { Blog } from '../../components';\n\nexport default function renee_lim() {\n    return (\n        <Blog.TextBlock>\n            <Blog.Author>Interviewed and written by Michael Wu</Blog.Author>\n            ‍<br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Text><i>Renee Lim is the Director of Program Development at the Pam McLean Centre, Senior Lecturer in Professional development at the University of Sydney, an actress, writer and performer in many shows such as “Please Like Me” and “Ask the Doctor”, as well as CEO of Changineers and a consultant for non profit organisations.

It helps me a lot in my other work. I think they all combine in some ways with my teaching work at Pam McLean: the more you understand humans, the more you understand why they do what they do.

I realized that those skills are particularly useful in geriatrics, palliative care and definitely in emergency. The patients in those settings are often at points of life where they really need as much support space and safety as possible to deal with what’s happening to them. Those spaces are often at the start of a healthcare interaction which is in the emergency department or at the end of an interaction which can be in palliative care for example. Geriatrics is the end of the interaction with life. In emergency you've got the medication, you've got the interventions: you will do them. When you're at the palliative care end of the spectrum it is again the opposite - no intervention is a form of intervention. In geriatrics it’s a balancing act - there are lots of clinical decisions you can make. In the end you will only be able to make one or two of them. It always comes back to what is most important - how the patient is feeling about what is happening. Sometimes the only thing you can do is change how the patient feels.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Later on I moved into teaching work because that became a more effective way to maximise what I could offer.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>FINDING YOUR FIELD 🤩</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>When I was in my intern year I did a neurosurgery term as well as in emergency and geriatrics. I decided I want to be one of those three. Neurosurgery was way too much work. I realised that my skill set definitely comes in being able to solve complex problems and engage with other humans. If I think from the perspective of “I’m part of a very large system that improves the lives of others, what can I offer that is most beneficial to that system?”, it is definitely not to go away and slog it out for 12 years as a surgical registrar and try to get good at that. While I might be able to do it, and I might be interested in clinical knowledge, and I might be capable of looking at a skin lesion and identifying it, my best set of skills for the healthcare system was going to be in the areas of complex problem solving, communication and relationships.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>How you plan your career is determined by a number of factors.

He worked in Aboriginal health in the Northern Territory, on HIV prevention in India and in the drug and alcohol sector. His key health priorities include preventative health, public dental care and responding to the health impacts of climate change.</Blog.Text>\n</i>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<Blog.Text><b>Erica:</b> To begin, tell us a little bit about how you ended up finding your way into a medical career and a little bit about your training.‍</Blog.Text>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<Blog.Text><b>Richard Di Natale:</b> I'd always wanted to do medicine for as long as I can remember. It’s interesting when you reflect on where you end up in life, but as a young person politics was the farthest thing from my mind. I was, right through my high school years, really committed to training in medicine. I suppose I'd like to think it comes from a good place. It's a profession where you get an opportunity to make a big contribution to people's lives and nothing is more important than people's health. For as long as I can remember I wanted to study medicine. I got into Monash and basically did my 6-year undergraduate degree at Monash. I then did my intern year and my first year of residency and was accepted into a physician pathway. At that point there I thought I'd probably end up becoming a physician.</Blog.Text>\n<Blog.Text>I do remember being a general physician at the time, and the idea of potentially doing some work in regional Australia was attractive. That was a path that I was on and then I made the, well it turned out to be a very fateful decision to take a year off after I did my internship. I basically took a year off to travel, and spent a year driving around Australia in a four-wheel drive with a mate of mine. He was also in the same stage of his medical career, so we did it together. I did some locum work while I was doing that in Aboriginal health. I realised there was a whole new world of possibilities in that part of medicine. I decided then rather than going back to become a physician, I’d spend some time working in Aboriginal health. That's basically where I think I got an interest in politics.</Blog.Text>\n<Blog.Text>I ended up working in an Aboriginal community-controlled health organization. This is back in the day when you didn't actually have to have your general practice fellowship to practice as a GP. I was working as a GP in Tennant Creek. I was there for a couple of years working as a GP as part of their community-controlled health clinic. During that time doing a Master of Public Health. I suppose the reason I did that was because I was interested in moving beyond just clinical medicine, into a more population health basis. Obviously, spending time working in an Aboriginal community opens your eyes to the critical importance of population health, rather than just clinical medicine.‍</Blog.Text>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<Blog.Text><b>Erica:</b> It sounds really interesting. We've certainly gotten a little bit of teaching about public health in our course and it's been fascinating so far.‍</Blog.Text>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<Blog.Text><b>Richard Di Natale:</b> I thought a public health teaching that we had through our undergraduate degree was really just the tip of the iceberg. It started off as an interest and I thought it was just an interest, and I thought if I wanted to spend working in Aboriginal health then maybe having a much stronger basis in population health was going to be helpful. My interest in politics grew from there.</Blog.Text>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<Blog.Text>‍<b>Erica:</b> That leads me to my next question. How did you end up transitioning into politics? You mentioned earlier it wasn't something you always wanted to do.‍</Blog.Text>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<Blog.Text><b>Richard Di Natale:</b> I think if you end up doing this job [medicine] you've got to have an understanding that politics is important. I've always felt that, even during my formative years, I’ve always thought politics is really important and always felt that it was really important to engage in politics, even if it's just through advocacy in the health sphere or whatever that might be. I've always seen politics as a very important in improving the health of communities, but more generally in terms of the impact that politics has on people's lives. I was interested but I wasn't somebody who came from a particularly political home environment. I didn't know anybody who was active in politics, so it always seemed to me to be something that was inaccessible, if you like.</Blog.Text>\n<Blog.Text>Then what happened was I came back to Melbourne, after I'd spent my years in the Northern Territory, and I did a Public Health fellowship. It was run by the Victorian Health Department in conjunction with La Trobe, and was a training program for doctors, but other health professionals as well. I came back to do that, and at that point I decided I'll join a party and get involved. Not really knowing where that would go, but at least knowing that I was getting more frustrated with the state of politics in the world. It was during Howard era. I had spent that time in Aboriginal health and was feeling like I needed to do more than just work behind a desk writing prescriptions. I joined The Greens. I knew a little bit about The Greens. I joined the party knowing a little bit about it, obviously knowing the policy platform, but not knowing a lot about the party because it was a very young party at that point in Victoria. But I knew that I didn't want to join the Liberal or Labor parties, because I was fed up with them. That was pretty much how I made my foray into politics.‍</Blog.Text>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<Blog.Text><b>Erica:</b> And from there you worked your way up?‍</Blog.Text>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<Blog.Text><b>Richard Di Natale:</b> Well, to be honest, in those days (and I've said this before) you drove past the office and you were being asked to stand as a candidate. I arrived in town and the party was young, there were elections coming up. I stood as a candidate within a short space of time of being a member. My first federal campaign was as a candidate for the federal seat of Wills and I enjoyed it. I felt like the party was growing. I feel like I had a voice, I felt empowered. It really just grew from there.‍</Blog.Text>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<Blog.Text><b>Erica:</b> Amazing. Are you still practicing medicine at all? I imagine probably not. Do you miss it?‍</Blog.Text>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<Blog.Text><b>Richard Di Natale:</b> No. One of the hard things for me was to give that up. I can't say I miss it. There are moments… I mean you certainly miss the immediacy of really making a difference to somebody in a meaningful way and getting that feedback. You don't get that much in politics. You certainly get a lot of feedback from people that don't like what you're doing. You get lots of immediate feedback online, but that's not real.</Blog.Text>\n<Blog.Text>One of the things about medicine, of course, is you make a big difference to somebody and you see them sometimes at the most difficult part of their life. You see them at the most profound moments - birth and death, and everywhere in between. To be able to share those intimate moments with people and to be able to help them through it is something you don't get in politics. I miss that, but I don't miss the day-to-day grind. There were parts of the job that I didn't enjoy.</Blog.Text>\n<Blog.Text>Of course, I'm in a very privileged position to be doing something that is immensely satisfying at a personal level, and it gives me a sense of purpose in life. I suppose, putting those two things together, I can't say I miss medicine greatly. So no, I don’t practice. During the first few years in the senate I continued to maintain my registration and professional development and so on, but then in making my transition to leader it just became too difficult, so I don't practice anymore.‍</Blog.Text>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<Blog.Text><b>Erica:</b> In terms of the skills, are there any skills that you learnt in medicine that you found are useful to politics? Inversely, are there any new skills you had to learn personally for your political career?‍</Blog.Text>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<Blog.Text><b>Richard Di Natale:</b> A working knowledge of personality disorders helps. I suppose the problem-solving framework work that you learn through medicine is a scientific discipline, but medicine is part science, part art. Politics has certainly, unfortunately, more art than science to it. In some ways it's frustrating, because if you come from a scientific background where evidence is important in drawing conclusions, it's bloody frustrating when people ignore evidence. They ignore what are very clear conclusions, based on quantifiable facts. That's the world we live in and so we just have to work within it.‍</Blog.Text>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<Blog.Text><b>Erica:</b> I guess the inverse of that question now: are there any new skills you had to learn personally for your political career?‍</Blog.Text>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<Blog.Text><b>Richard Di Natale:</b> Obviously, in politics your role is much more public and it's real important to try and improve your skills around talking to big groups of people and public speaking in a way that engages with people. It's true there's some of that in medicine, depending on what area of medicine you work in and whether you're teaching and so on. I'd say any other thing in politics, a part of the job particularly in the role that I play, is you've got to be a good manager. The management skills in terms of the way you manage a team of people, the way you work with your colleagues, not just your MPs but your staff and so on, all of those are skills that are not something you're really taught in medicine. At least not while I was studying. They are things that you certainly have to pick up as you work through your political career.‍</Blog.Text>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<Blog.Text><b>Erica:</b> Certainly. In general, and this is a very broad question, but do you think doctors make good politicians? Why or why not?‍</Blog.Text>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<Blog.Text><b>Richard Di Natale:</b> Some do, and some don't. I think the skills you learn in medicine are certainly helpful but there’s no guarantee that you'll be a good politician simply because you're trained in medicine. We've had doctors and vets in parliament who don't believe in the science of climate change. It's hard to believe but there are people in parliament who are trained in what should be scientific disciplines who tend to ignore the science if it's not consistent with their ideological views. I suppose that's one of the things you do learn in this job, is that people's ideology sometimes trumps facts and reason. So that’s an interesting little insight into human behaviour. I could cite obviously [Bob] Brown is a mentor for me, and himself a doctor, and I'd say he's one of the most effective politicians in the country. I'm not going to name any others on the other side of the equation, but there are people in the parliament who have been doctors who I'd say have been very ineffective as politicians. Completely lacking not just in science, but also empathy.‍</Blog.Text>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<Blog.Text><b>Erica:</b> This actually a question from some of my friends asked me to include. A lot of them felt a little bit dispirited after the recent [federal] election results, particularly around the environment. What advice would you give to people who really care about these issues, but who feel powerless to affect any meaningful change?‍</Blog.Text>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<Blog.Text><b>Richard Di Natale:</b> The first thing I'd say is don't give up. You can't give up. The second thing I'd say is that change is hard. You are fighting against very powerful interest groups who benefit from the status quo, who don't want change because it will impact on them. Big multinational companies, cashed-up, making huge donations to both sides of politics. But there is a movement of people growing right here in Australia and right around the world who are connecting and are going to be the only way we get to change the status quo.</Blog.Text>\n<Blog.Text>I'm actually very hopeful and optimistic about young people. They are so many young people involved in climates strikes and so on. It's only a matter of time before their voices are heard. So, my advice to them is don't give up. Get involved and stay involved. Join a political party. Hopefully that's the Greens. Make your voice heard through that. Find a cause that you're passionate about, whether it be climate change or an environmental issue, and join an advocacy organization, make your voice heard through them. Make sure you know who your local member is and advocate through them. Make a time to meet with them, hassle them. Get involved, stay involved, advocate. Because the only way things will change is if enough people who understand how critical climate change is and the fact that we're on the brink of one of the great ecological extinctions. It's only people who understand where we're at and the urgency at which we need to act. ‍</Blog.Text>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<Blog.Text><b>Erica:</b> You've had multiple positions as a spokesperson on health. Do you think it's important that the parliamentary representative for a portfolio has some kind of formal training in the area that they are making decisions on?‍</Blog.Text>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<Blog.Text><b>Richard Di Natale:</b> Look, I think it's helpful, but I don't think it's absolutely critical. I've seen people go into a portfolio area with little or no training or experience in it, and spend time talking to people, understanding the issues and they do a great job. Equally, I've seen people with a background in some areas who come into it thinking that they know it all and come in with a very single-minded perspective and really stuff it up. I don't think it's critical, I think it's helpful and I think if you've got some training or experience in a particular field, providing you can keep an open mind, providing you’re willing to hear from other perspectives on the topic from right across the spectrum, then you'll do a good job of it.</Blog.Text>\n<Blog.Text>The most important thing is to go in there with an open mind, be really clear about where people are coming from when they try to advocate for the position. Make sure you make use of the resources that you've got at your disposal, both in terms of the bureaucracy and the institution in parliament and then you can arrive at a judgment. Like I said, people who go into the job thinking they know it all don't do a good job of the area that they're working on. It can be a big asset though, and I found that personally for me to be a really big asset. I think for me, what it does do is, people come into the office and they trust you. They trust that you've got an understanding of the topic, they trust that you understand the issues and so you automatically start from that perspective with people. Your bullshit detector is also much more finely tuned if you're trained in that area. So, I think it’s not critical, but helpful providing that you're prepared to go in with an open mind.‍</Blog.Text>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<Blog.Text><b>Erica:</b> What advice would you give to medical students or junior doctors, generally, and also to those who might be considering or interested in engaging in politics?‍</Blog.Text>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<Blog.Text><b>Richard Di Natale:</b> A medical degree is a wonderful privilege, and it opens up so many doors and so many possibilities for people. I never for a moment thought that I would end up where I am. As I said when I got into medicine, I saw my life within medicine and not outside of it. I think having a medical degree opened up doors that maybe might not have been opened up to me if I didn't have the background that I have.</Blog.Text>\n<Blog.Text>The advice I'd give to people is firstly don't feel like you need to know where your life is going to go now. Don't feel the pressure of feeling like you have to make pretty good decisions that will lock you in for the rest of your life. That's more general advice. The people who do best in medicine are the people who I think have a broad range of skills and haven't been down a very narrow path early on.</Blog.Text>\n<Blog.Text>When it comes specifically to politics, I'd say to people that regardless of wherever they work and whatever they do, politics is going to have an impact on their lives, or have an impact on their professional career, and it will also have an impact on their life more generally. If there are people who have a strong sense of injustice, then really the only way to make change is to actually get involved and be engaged. You can do that by joining a party and that's “capital P” politics I suppose, where you join a party and get involved in the way that I did. But depending on your interests, you could join Doctors for Refugees, or Doctors for the Environment, or even AMA politics. They all give you an opportunity to learn skills in those areas. To understand how power works in a way that you might not appreciate until you're actually in those positions. To know that there's always a possibility of pursuing that if you are fulfilled by it, if you feel like you are achieving something.</Blog.Text>\n<Blog.Text>There isn't a direct pathway. People often say to me, \"How do I get involved in politics?\" I'd say to them first thing is try and get some skills in another area and bring something. Bring a perspective and a set of skills and experience that aren’t just skills to do with “capital P” politics. One of the problems we've got in politics is people spend their life doing a political degree at uni, then they go and work as a political staff. They work in political office all their life, and then they end up as MPs. I think it's a good thing to come to it a little later in life and bring skills and experience that actually add something to the parliament. I'd say you don't have to make any of those decisions early.

I always enjoyed learning of biology, medicine and about the human body and a few school teachers had said to me ‘What about medicine?’. I thought, well, why not give it a go? To be honest, I never really knew what area of medicine I liked as a medical student, I was just focused on passing my exams and becoming a doctor. I don't think a lot of medical students do think about where they want to be, but then you're in the hospital and you become an intern. Internship was such a busy year for me. All I knew was that I wasn't really liking what I was actually doing as an intern. That’s when the seeds of medical career planning started. I thought ‘gosh, why isn't there someone that can give you some independent, impartial advice that isn't your employer?’. At the time, I kept looking and looking and eventually I found general practice and I really loved it. The training program provided flexibility to figure out what you did like in medicine because it’s such a general career.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>Why Medical Career planning? 🤔</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>To help doctors! These highly motivated, highly intelligent people who have such ability to make such a huge impact on the world, in some cases haven't realized what they want to do yet.

You can make someone's training and experience an enjoyable process. I started doing Master of Clinical Education whilst I was doing my GP training. I love the fact that as an educator you can make that difference. You can make it interesting; you can make it fun, and you can teach in many different ways. I love the challenge of thinking about the group of people you're teaching and thinking about how they learn best. Is it classroom teaching? Is it small group learning? Is it one on one, is it online? When you train as a Medical educator you are in this safe, supportive room of people that actually are there to make the medical student or the junior doctor or the registrar or consultant’s education a better journey.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>Rewarding tales from work ⚕️</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>One memorable story came from a staff specialist, I won't say what specialty they came from, but they said to me ‘I just want to leave medicine, What other careers outside of medicine could you see me doing?’. The whole process of counselling isn't just to jump in and say what they would be good at or what career they should do. It's to try and challenge their thinking, but also their past experiences and where they see themselves going in the future to be able to let them come up with the answers themselves.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>It took a little while to figure it out, but we identified that they were overbooked and stressed out in their clinics, and after recommending they try and reduce the amount of referrals coming and amount of bookings.

It's not until you speak to doctors that have gone part-time or have taken time off or have put their selves before their job that you feel like you can have permission to do that yourself. I know when I was working as a junior doctor it felt like you were slack if you said ‘no, no I want to go to my net ball game’ or ‘I can't work over time’ or ‘I want to go to my family wedding on the weekend’. I think what there's now a real move to try and make hospital doctors understand, especially the junior doctors that there's more to life and you don't need to sacrifice what you love to try and make it work.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>What would you like to change about the current hospital system? 🏥</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I know it's not economical and it's not probably the way hospitals work, but I'd love to see hospitals allowing their doctors a bit more space in their working environment to pursue some more creative interests in medicine. Getting involved in administration, helping writing policies for their department, doing some different things within the hospital system that could really enhance a person's interests in medicine. There’s a wide variety of things such as health economics, health informatics, getting involved in digital health, and health promotion that one can get involved with.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>Frustrations with the medical profession 😡</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I think I find it very frustrating personally, knowing that people feel they have to change their careers completely because a college has a set of rules that are so inflexible. I know there are reasons for those rules, but when you speak to someone who's a year away from completing their ICU training, but for whatever reason they can't take leave that they desperately need to get to sort their life out, this doctor is going to turn around and have to do something completely different because the set of rules are so rigid. I find that very difficult to understand.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>Billboard Message 💬</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>What would you regret not doing the most in life?</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n        </Blog.TextBlock>\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\nimport { Blog } from '../../components';\n\nexport default function simon_judkins() {\n    return (\n        <Blog.TextBlock>\n            <Blog.Author>Interviewed and written by Sarah Jackson</Blog.Author>\n            ‍<br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Text><i>Dr Simon Judkins is the President of ACEM (Australasian College of Emergency Medicine), where he works on driving change in our health system to align with the principles of equitable access to care, social justice and fairness.

Given the breadth of positions of power doctors can hold, and the sphere of influence they can have, would you agree with the statement that being a doctor is a privilege?‍</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>Yeah it’s an interesting idea - that being a doctor is a privileged position. I think it should be seen as a privilege for clinicians to actually be trusted as they are, and that they should not take advantage of that privilege. I’ve always thought that there’s a moral responsibility to try and use that privilege to provide as much help to people as you can. I don’t think working as a doctor is just about turning up to work, doing a job, and then going home. I can understand why people do it, but if you have the opportunity, and I think we all have the opportunity when you’re working as a clinician, you can make a significant impact on your patients’ lives.‍</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>2. You have your role as the president of ACEM, and you're also still practicing clinically. How do you manage to split your time between two such demanding facets of your life?‍</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>It's tricky. I'm lucky from both counts in that I've got an ED that's actually very supportive. They’re very flexible, but at the same time, I've got a responsibility to them. Unfortunately that sometimes means that I do a lot of unsociable work hours, like a Sunday day shift. This job is 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It doesn’t have to be, but in some respects it needs to be if we are going to be serious about healthcare advocacy and ensuring that we get our message out there about the health system, and to make sure that we're ready to respond to politicians in a timely manner. I think we've done that pretty well over the last couple of years.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>It's difficult to manage the time, but there are other people around you to help out and there's an enormous amount of trust and faith. Everybody is doing a great job. I'm quite fortunate that I've got a really good support network here, because I'm still full time at the Austin. This does count for a little of my time, but I still probably average three shifts a week, and occasionally I do a disco shift working till 2 or 3 O'clock in morning. I think because I'm torn between two places, I need to ensure that I’m still pulling my weight when it comes to the Austin - because as I said, they're being great and supportive. ‍</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>3. Did you always know that you wanted to do ED?‍</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>My grandfather was a GP and he was of the old school. He was that classic GP - a guardian of the community. He was always available, always did home visits, and he was always around when people needed him. His work was his life and his life was his work, and he was just a fantastic person, so I always wanted to do medicine and be like him.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Understandably I started off by thinking about becoming a GP. Then way back when I was an intern, I was did surgery for my first rotation and thought that was of interest. But then I think the first time I did some ED stuff I just really loved it. It was big and busy and I thought this is pretty cool. Again there was that sense of: I can do some good stuff, it’s fun, I’m surrounded by really interesting people who are really supportive, and so it was just perfect. I think I just liked the whole concept of being a big team with no hierarchy. Probably the first time I walked into the ED I thought to myself “yea this is the thing for me.” And I stuck on with it from then on.‍</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>4. Do you think there are particular problems that are unique to Australia's emergency departments?‍</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I think the Australian healthcare system is pretty amazing really. I don't think the challenges are unique to the Australian healthcare system - limitation to healthcare access is a common thread among many healthcare systems across the world. If you build a hospital, people will come, and so there always seems to be a healthcare deficit. I think one of the biggest challenges personally is that I don't think the people who are working outside the ED actually understand much about what goes on inside the ED. And so when we talk about things like the issues around access and overcrowding in emergency departments, people hear the words but I don't think they actually understand what that means to be in an environment where you've got forty people in the waiting room, ten ambulances waiting, your whole emergency department is full and ambulances are trying to offload because they get calls out in the community because there's somebody with chest pain.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I think we understand that solutions to this lie in the whole hospital system, but if you're not working in the ED, it’s difficult to understand. Sometimes you feel a bit isolated because you're just going 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and despite people talking about system responses, sometimes you feel as though sometimes the system isn't responding.‍</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>5. In putting together your book ‘Untold Stories of the ED’, was it hard to choose which stories to include and which to omit?‍</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>There was some that you couldn't put in because they would probably be just too distressing, and some that were not interesting because they happens all the time. But ultimately, we were working with people in publishing, and so we took their advice on what stories people want to hear. I think we've got a good depth and breadth of stories. The other thing that was really fascinating for me was that it humanised the work we did as a whole.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Text>One of the ED clinicians I work with had been very burnt out from doing emergency medicine and wasn’t quite sure about what he wanted to do with his career. He was a registrar at that stage and he was doing some work in Fiji while he figured out what he wanted to do. He sent me an email saying he was sitting on a bench reading the book, and a couple of days later he sent me another email asking “can I come back?” He said that that was hie epiphany, his turning point to realise that what we do does actually make a difference.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n        </Blog.TextBlock>\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\nimport { Blog } from '../../components';\n\nexport default function linny_kimly_phuong() {\n    return (\n        <Blog.TextBlock>\n            <Blog.Author>Interviewed and written by Jefferson Tang</Blog.Author>\n            ‍<br/>\n            <br/>\n            <i>\n            <Blog.Text>‍Linny Phuong is the Chair and Founder of The Water Well Project - a not-for-profit that provides much needed health education to refugees and asylum seekers.

My sisters and I were born in Australia, so we got to see what it was like for them to navigate the Australian healthcare system. We attended their medical appointments and acted as interpreters for them. As a practicing pharmacist it became apparent to me how important primary healthcare was, and that accessible health information made a big difference as it enabled patients to engage in preventative care.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>As junior doctors, most of us engage almost solely in acute care when people get to the hospital. Health education sessions delivered by The Water Well Project are delivered in spaces outside of the hospitals and clinic rooms, thus allowing individuals to feel more comfortable and ask questions. Healthcare professional volunteers are afforded an opportunity to get hear firsthand stories from refugees and asylum seekers about their barriers to better health outcomes, including cultural beliefs and stigmas. To add to this, a lot of our volunteers feel quite satisfied after doing a health education session, having contributed to the community using their unique set of skills and knowledge.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>The Water Well Project sessions allow group discussion, which means that participants can learn from each others’ stories, rather than receiving a one-sided lecture.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Personally, I think one of the most important topics we cover is mental health. Many of the communities we work with experience mental health issues, partly due to their journeys which lead to their arrival in Australia. Our mental health sessions cover mental health awareness, so that participants learn how being able to recognise symptoms in themselves and in each other, and also provides them with an introduction to relaxation techniques. It’s a very sensitive topic, so we know to be really careful when we deliver these sessions.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>JUGGLING WORK AND MULTIPLE PROJECTS 🤹</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I love my job.

With the degrees I did - I really enjoyed pharmacy when I was studying it, I really enjoyed medicine when I studied that, and I really enjoyed my public health degree, as it was a different stage in my career journey and I was able to balance it with work. I think it’s important to follow your passion and find what gives you joy. This may sound very cheesy, but I’ve found it to be true.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>MEDICAL CAREER ADVICE 👩‍⚕️</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>Don’t let the climb consume you. You’ll feel like you’re competing against your colleagues who are all very smart, all Type A personalities, seemingly going for similar positions and who have almost identical backgrounds. You can try to get ahead by doing research projects and publications, in addition to your exam study and full-time work. However, I think it’s a lot! It’s definitely something that perhaps medical students and junior doctors need to consider and somehow be better prepared for.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>My advice is to pursue your passion. Don’t be put off by people telling you that there’s no job in whatever specialty you want to be in. If you’re passionate about it, you’re going to be great at it and opportunities will come up. Personally, along my journey, I have been told not to do paediatrics or infectious diseases due to limited job opportunities - how this pans out, we will see. But I really believe you’ve got to create your own path, and hopefully opportunities will arise in doing so.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>LIFE ADVICE 🧬</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>Put yourself in the shoes of others. It’s hard to consider why people are reacting the way they are, until you consider what they are feeling or experiencing. The Water Well Project constantly teaches me about considering the individual. Someone in front of me, may avoid healthcare or be particularly vulnerable to depression due to their lived experiences; another may thrive in spite of their experiences. People are so interesting. If someone shares a story with you, if you really listen, you may learn something new.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n        </Blog.TextBlock>\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\nimport { Blog } from '../../components';\n\nexport default function tim_read() {\n    return (\n        <Blog.TextBlock>\n            <Blog.Author>Interviewed and written by Erica Musgrove</Blog.Author>\n            ‍<br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Text><b>Eternal Possibilities' 50th post 🎉🎉🎉</b></Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Text><i>‍Tim Read is the first ever Greens Member of Parliament (MP) who was elected to represent the district of Brunswick, Melbourne in 2018.

I got into medicine straight after school, and I think I was 17 at the beginning of first year. I was always interested in science and research, though not necessarily that committed to medicine. I actually had become, through my university time, very interested in politics and after my intern year, decided to go into a cadetship at The Age. I lasted 18 months, partly because The Age was in tumult at the time, but also I felt that my talents probably were better suited to medicine. But my political interest remained. One of the things I’ve just observed throughout medicine, from starting off in general practice working in community health centres, and then more recently when specializing in sexual health and in research, is the importance of government policy in determining people’s fate. I joined the Greens about 10 years ago mainly concerned about climate change. Then, one thing led to another, and here we are.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Text><b>Erica:</b> That leads me into one of my other questions which is how did you get into politics?

I joined the Greens at the end of 2008 when I saw the then government was proposing an emission scheme that was going to reduce our emissions by 5% and I thought, “That’s it, I’m joining the Greens.” A lot of other people joined around the same time. I joined with very little idea of what kind of a contribution I would make. I didn’t even know how political parties work but I wanted to find out, and so I just helped out and observed and contributed where I could.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>About five years ago, it became clear they were looking for candidate for Brunswick, and there was a Federal election coming up and they needed a candidate for the overlapping Federal State of Wills. There was no chance we were going to win, and so I thought it would be just an interesting thing to try out. I did that and I liked it and I enjoyed the interaction with local people and the little policy debates that it involves and decided to have a serious tilt at Brunswick. We ran quite a good campaign in 2014 and closed the margin. The sitting member then could see us coming and decided to find an upper house seat, and that made it easier for us to win it last year, but we only just won.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Text><b>Erica:</b> Interesting.

I’ve realized that I have to let go and be willing to make claims at times when we think we’re probably right, but not entirely sure. Before people get too horrified about that, I should stress that it’s more to do with how you communicate things. Political communication just has to be a lot simpler than medical communication, and so you have to stop using qualifying adjectives and be more direct. So, I’ve had to break out of the medical mould for that.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>But I do think medicine does help you see the links between policy and behaviour and people’s health. So, I remain interested in health and in health policy. I’m also aware that the most important health policies aren’t in the formal health policy. They are policies that determine, do people sit in their cars on their way to work or do they ride bikes or walk to public transport stops? It’s also in the policies that determine whether we’re exposed to billboards advertising junk food or in the policies around illegal drugs. These are the most important health policies, and the other policies I’m interested in critiquing and maybe having some influence on.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Text><b>Erica:</b> I saw a little bit of that again looking over your website.

I guess as a medical student, I saw the relative futility of treating patients one at a time, when at that time, there were cigarette ads everywhere persuading them to smoke. Public health always ... No, sorry, I’ll go back a step. I think healthcare is always working against the headwind when we’ve got corporations advertising to people to do things that are bad for their health. No amount of telling individuals to eat broccoli is very useful when they step out of the surgery and see a three-meter-long Mars Bar. So, we need to change the environment that people live in.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>You will have heard of the phrase “The Obesogenic Environment”. That’s one of the things I’d like to work on. That, I think, was why I got interested in public health in the first place and it’s why I remain interested. One of the really interesting things is that people who talk about public health or population health in those terms get accused of wanting in nanny-state. But I think we already live in a nanny state where we have a different nanny, a corporate nanny telling us to eat Mars Bars and drink lots of Chardonnay and drive these amazing SUVs to work. That corporate nanny is telling us what to do and we need to rein her in.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Text><b>Erica:</b> How do you envisage this change to the obesogenic environment?

Well, I want to do as much as I can to get rid of energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods, at least advertising for them. We can’t ban foods or drink or even drugs, but at the very least we can reduce the amount of promotion that people are exposed to.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Text><b>Erica:</b> Do you think that promotion extends to the online world now? Because I was listening to a podcast yesterday and they were very much talking about social media and that influence on the younger generation verses maybe us being less engaged in billboards. I don’t even know if our policies extend that far at the moment.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Text><b>Tim Read:</b> I’m sure it does. It just makes it a little bit more difficult to regulate them. In the state realm, we’re even more limited in what we can do, but the state owns a lot of billboards in the public transport infrastructure, for example. So, that’s one area where we can make a change.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Text><b>Erica:</b> If I gave you a magic ward and you could wave it and change one thing about Australia, well, maybe Victoria right now, what would it be and why?</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Text><b>Tim Read:</b> It would be that we stop burning over a million tons of coal a week, which is a little-known statistic that is impossible to justify knowing what we know. Harking back to an earlier question, one of the skills I did get from medicine was assessing evidence, and the evidence that we’re in a climate emergency is convincing. So, my magic ward would replace our coal fire power stations with clean energy and clean industry. It is technically possible but requires some spending.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Text><b>Erica:</b> You mentioned before that you did a cadetship at The Age, which is something that I didn’t know.

I do remember hearing about some research findings and ringing a doctor to find out more about them and he was begging with me not to publish it because that information was being embargoed for some dramatic media release with a relevant minister. I remember bridling against that sense of being managed, but in the end, we did as we were asked because we didn’t particularly want to dump a doctor in it even though we had no sympathy whatsoever for the government department that was trying to manipulate everything.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>So, now here I’m talking to reporters. Although not being a government minister, I don’t particularly have any secrets or things that I need to manipulate. Our difficulty is more just being acknowledged for our policy contribution. That’s the challenge we’re up against.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Text><b>Erica:</b> Going back to medicine now, what advice would you give to medical students or junior doctors at the moment who are in that training and particularly those who might be unsure about where their career might be heading, or anyone who might be interested in politics?</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Text>Tim Read: Sure. Well, look, I wouldn’t recommend to anybody ever having a career in politics because there’s no job security in politics, and I don’t think the community gets the best benefits out of career politicians. I think we should see parliament and local council, I might add, a much underrated and very important part of our politics. We should see parliaments and councils as a bit like jury service, where the ordinary people doing ordinary jobs take some time out of their life to make a contribution.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I think the most important thing if you’re politically active that you can do, and I’d say this to everybody is to pay closer attention and to be sceptical and to seek out information from a variety of news sources. Also, if you’re feeling like you want to get more involved is to identify whatever for you is the least worst political party and join it. You’ll never find a political party that’s perfect or that matches all your policies but ask yourself what are the big challenges of the times that I want to tackle? What’s the least worst party for dealing with that and join it and make it better. Maybe then, leave and join another one if you’re not happy.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>But I essentially encourage people to get involved, but don’t think of yourself as having a political career; think of yourself as maybe being able to make a contribution at some level. The political career happens if a bunch of people get behind you and say, “Hey, we want you.” Political careers, as we all know, come to an end, so you need to think of yourself as having some other identity and the politics is a little bit on the side.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Text><b>Erica:</b> Yes.

Whether it’s exploiting the environment or exploiting employees or treating us as a market. Essentially, I think there’s a risk that we’re just a theme park for corporations to have fun in and then they leave. We’re going to dig up your stuff, we’re going to pay you as little as possible; pay as little tax as possible, you can eat the shit we make and see you later. That’s an extreme caricature, but the only reason things aren’t quite that bad is because of regulation and the activity of parliaments. I think standing up to the free market is a critical role, and I think doctors have a unique insight into the importance of that kind of regulation.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Text><b>Erica:</b> A good note to end on.

Then I also got interested in medicine as well. It became a bit of a natural fit together. Before medicine I spent more time doing some techie things. After I was in med school and started working as a doctor, I saw that tech could really be used quite a bit in medicine and can be used to improve the way we do things.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I've always helped out in various units with whatever tech issues there were, be that in spreadsheets, audits and things like that. My first proper real big meaty project was the journal, about technology in medicine. That sort of sparked my interest in getting involved in more big projects like that. It's where I learned about how to set up these projects and how to make them happen.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>Could you tell us about the story behind the Journal of Mobile Technology in Medicine?</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>Yeah, sure. Initially the idea came about because me and one of my other friends, we were doing some research papers for ophthalmology. We were both keen on getting onto the ophthalmology training programs. What we did is we basically went around the hospital and essentially the aim was to check the accuracy of the various smartphone visual acuity apps. We wanted to know are they valid compared to a Snellen visual acuity chart, which is the gold standard? We thought this would be a great study to do. We basically just went around the ward, tested people with Snellen acuity chart, and also with an iPhone app as well. Then we also looked at the app store, because there's a whole bunch of different acuity apps. What we found was a wide variety of the quality of them, because the letters are supposed to be set in two sizes at certain distance. We picked one that at least gave the correct size and did that.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>We finished up that study and then we were looking at where should publish this. What we found at the time, this was quite a few years ago, when the app things or medical things were just starting to take off, there really wasn't a good place for it. They either tended to go to a small niche journal, or into some random tech journal that no medical people actually read. That's when we thought, actually this might be a good chance, a good opportunity to maybe try and foster some more research in the area. Also, rather than waiting for other people to provide that solution, why don't we just get on and do it? At the time, both me and my friend had done some other research stuff before as well. We floated the idea of starting our own journal, thought about it for a little while and eventually one day I was like, let's do it! We sat down, wrote out a business plan out - this is going to be how we are going to start; this is how we're going to get going, and maybe this is how it might look a bit down on the track. Then just started executing the plan to see what happens, and it worked.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>A personal hunch I've had is that perhaps the mobile app space for health care is particularly over-saturated, at least in the last few years. What do you personally think?</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I think it's just the bigger ecosystem of digital health in general. It's not really something new to medicine really with all of the tech stuff. It's just new tools to provide care to patients. Whatever that tool may be, whether that's something on a mobile phone or whatever it may be. It's just new ways of delivering and managing healthcare which previously didn't exist. Previously people didn't have the equivalent of a smartphone, that you can use to communicate with patients. That's something that we took on to Nebula, where really the aim of that start-up was around communicating with patients. I think it's a space that got pretty crowded pretty fast. I guess that's what happens with any new area, which is open for entrance from anywhere.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>I'd love to learn the story behind Nebula Health:</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>Sure. After I was on the [ophthalmology] training program, especially after doing the general stuff, then I started reading more and more about start-ups, more just out of necessity of trying to work out how to run the journal. This is all while being quite busy working and being a reg and all that sort of stuff. After reading more about start-ups, I started to learn more about how to run the journal. I thought, this actually seems like fun and I really wanted to give it a go. I took a year off after my first year of ophthalmology training. I wanted to basically learn more about how start-ups work and figure something out.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Actually, I got on to a start-up accelerator in Melbourne called Open Accelerator Program, together with one of my other friends, who's now an ENT surgeon. We were both quite keen on the digital health space. We decided to do something. We got into the start-up accelerator together with them and another development agency, because neither of us could do any coding and they were quite good. We got in initially with the idea of wanting to automate or standardize the way that healthcare is delivered in the hospital. Because what we saw was things are pretty segmented. If a patient comes in with a fairly straightforward diagnosis, there's a pretty predictable path that they followed through the hospital. A pretty predictable set of tasks that need to be done, and pretty predictable communication that needs to happen around the patient, which we thought was done fairly poorly, and could have been done a lot better. We actually started working with some units and started developing some software to try to address that problem.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>As we were going, what we learned was that as a start-up, especially in the Australian health system, dealing with hospitals as your main client was not an ideal way to do a start-up. It’s a very, very long sales cycle, and the problem with that is then as a start-up you want to be able to do is move in your rate quickly, which you can't really do that when you don't really get any validation. Or if you do, the validation you get is really limited until they [the hospitals] eventually end up deciding to try it or not.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Towards the end of that year, one of the other problems I guess my colleague and I had personally experienced was around communicating with patients before and after surgery. Because often when you contact a patient, you send them to surgery, and they forget everything that you tell them. You see them day one, and then you might not see them for quite a while. Often the patients need to see something. We wanted to have a tool where basically you could have a video of your surgeon delivered to you at key points in time during your patient journey. Telling you, “Hey, you're about to have surgery tomorrow, here's what to expect, this is what the hospital will look like. I'll see you at surgery then.” After the surgery, \"Hey, its day one, a bit of pain today is normal. Take the all blah blah blah medications. If you have any of these things, make sure you come back to hospital.\" Then another message might be saying, “Hey, it's a week since the operation. This is what's normal, this is what's not.”</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>The idea is to reassure the patient, but also giving them relevant information in between follow-up visits basically. We found that that was something that surgeons really wanted and patients quite like that as well. So, we decided to change the tact of what we were doing. We got going with that, which was pretty good and pretty exciting. That's been running, and quite a few practices using it. We shifted a little bit in the way that we delivered that product.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>What advice would you have for people who are interested in the digital health space?</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>Probably the biggest thing is just get involved and give it a crack in whatever way you can. If you're not sure and you’re just curious et cetera, then go along to some events. See if you can ask a couple of start-ups or people working in this space. \"Hey, can I volunteer for a little bit, or can I hang out with you guys for a little bit and see what you guys do?\" Most people are more than happy to teach and show you what's happening, if you’re somebody who seems to be actually interested. Then other things I think is good is if you're like, \"Yeah, I got a bit of a taste for it and it looks fun.\" Then to actually try to get involved in whatever capacity you can.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>One of the hard things for medical people is time commitment. It's definitely quite hard to juggle the two. Even if you're able to do a project which maybe isn't starting a start-up that, for example, starting with something like a journal project or project you’re doing. The sorts of projects which you can do as an after-hours kind of thing. You can still make it work at some level and show it later on. If you start something that's always a good way to learn, as I find with most things in med. It's like an apprenticeship. You do it and learn.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>If you could have a gigantic billboard anywhere with anything on it metaphorically speaking, getting a message out there to millions and billions what would it say and why?</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>Don't be in too much of a rush to get where you're going, and actually enjoy the journey along the way. Have a look around on the journey, because you might find there's another destination you want to get to. People that think that are enjoying something or think they might like to do something, great. Just test it out. Don't be afraid to just test stuff out. See if it works. If it doesn't, be ready to move on to try something else.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n        </Blog.TextBlock>\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\nimport { Blog } from '../../components';\n\nexport default function kate_tyson() {\n    return (\n        <Blog.TextBlock>\n            <Blog.Author>Interviewed by Avi Bart</Blog.Author>\n            <Blog.Author>Written by Jefferson Tang</Blog.Author>\n            ‍<br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Text><i>Kate Tyson is the current Chief Registrar of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at Western Health at the Joan Kirner Women’s and Children’s Hospital.

I always thought that she was cool because she also had a Masters degree in Italian Language, and so I thought, “Oh if she wants to do O&G, it must be really good.” I was initially pursuing the GP training track, did a rotation in O&G along the way, and just loved it. I found everyone really friendly and the environment really approachable.  I loved the engagement of women at critical times in their lives and found it really stimulating.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>After that I did a senior resident O&G year and applied to the O&G training program. I had a really bad interview and so I didn’t get onto the training program the first time round. I had done 18 months of O&G up to that point, and I had reached the point where I was not that keen to spend much more time working in the Australian medical environment. So I approached the Professor of Obstetrics and asked him for career advice on what I should do.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>We looked at all the mainstream options and I found the MSF option enticing. I then told him that I really wanted to work with MSF and did he think that it would be acceptable for someone who’s keen to do O&G training in Australia - he thought it would be. With his support I went through the rigorous application process for working with MSF. I got in and agreed to work with them for nine months, which is the minimum amount of time you need to commit.

Jumping out of that system, and going off the radar to do something different was thought of as career suicide by many trainee doctors who thought you would never onto training in Australia if you did that.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I guess I’m lucky in that I had the support of the Professor of Obstetrics at the hospital I wanted to work at, who saw that working with the MSF would be a good thing for me to do. Personally I felt that it was the best thing for me do at that point in time. To me the purpose of being a doctor is to be able to help people, and I felt that continuing to work in Australia at that point would have just been for the sake of getting onto the training program, and not actually helping myself or anyone else. Over the next few years I experienced the great need for people with even basic medical skills; common sense and basic knowledge is exactly what is needed in many contexts to save lives.

There were lots of frustrations and difficulties I had to confront during my time with MSF. For example most missions are in highly insecure locations so you are not free to go where you please. You also only have your expat colleagues to socialise with; you don’t always get along and it’s sometimes difficult to resolve conflict when you come from diverse cultural backgrounds. But the ability to make a real difference throws all of that out of the water - you realise that you save lives everyday by the teaching and training you do, and the legacy you leave behind overweights the burdens of being there.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>MSF as an organisation is an outstanding organisation that abides by their values 100%. They are a secular humanitarian non-government organisation whose aim is to help the people in greatest need at any one point in time. They are not challenged or threatened by saying it’s too hard. They will go to the hardest places at the hardest times.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I’ve made some beautiful friends along the way because no matter your differences, you share the same values. You face the difficult situations together in the shared spirit of working to help people in greatest need.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Diversity of experience, diversity of skills and diversity of engagement all only make you a better clinician because you can approach things with a more broad perspective. You are able to understand a broader range of patient feelings, thoughts and attitudes. So no matter what it is, committing to a pursuit outside of medicine will only improve your clinical practice by giving you a better breadth of human experiences.‍</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>If you work hard at your job, your job will give back to you ✨</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>You get energy back by going that extra mile and doing something extra for the patient. The patient will recognise this and they’ll send you a card, or their relative will phone you and say thank you, or someone will say, “You did a really good job at that.” That gives you energy back. Also, if you take time to notice and appreciate it in other people, it will pay for it as well. If you work towards generating that climate of gratitude and positive reinforcement around you, it comes back to reward you with enhanced energy and purpose.‍</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>We can do better in supporting our colleagues when they go through challenging phases 💪💪💪</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>When you’re really under the pump, and someone else says to you, “Hey, you’re really under the pump, you’re doing a good job” - that will make a world of difference. It makes a difference when you identify someone going through a challenging phase and you take the time to sit down with them and tell them “What you’re going through is actually really hard.”</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>We have official training supervisor roles, but it’s just not the same as taking the time to sit down with someone and chat about how difficult something was. We don’t always make the right choices and medicine is inherently difficult. Bad things happens all the time because bad things just happen, not because you did a bad job. ‍</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>Personal regrets - I would have been bolder with my aspirations 💥</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>For personal perspective, my mom is a hard dresser, my dad is an electrician and I came into medicine through the rural entry scheme. I had an inferiority complex coming into medical school, and I was delighted to actually like my work and that people seemed to like me and the work I did.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>But I was really a bit intimidated by people who dreamt really big, who really wanted to do all the big and wonderful things in medicine. I would tell my younger self to “let go of that insecurity and just dream big. Be bold and reach for things. It’s fine if you don’t get there, just do you best. Do whatever you want to do and don’t be afraid to approach it.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>‍The other advice I would give is that you don't have to know your vision immediately 🤔</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>Your vision will change as you grow. So many of my friends have started on one path and ended up on another, and that’s a great result. When I was in medical school I aspired towards being a GP. Coincidentally most of my friends have coincidentally become GPs and they have a wonderful practice and a wonderful life. They find it really fulfilling.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>The most inspirational people I’ve worked with during my career are the people who have done multiple things over the years, and have taken time out of medicine to pursue other passions in life.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n        </Blog.TextBlock>\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\nimport { Blog } from '../../components';\n\nexport default function exam_edition_1  () {\n    return (\n        <Blog.TextBlock>\n            <Blog.Author>Interviewed and written by Jefferson Tang</Blog.Author>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Text>Meet Emily Warton and Daniel Hynes, two friendly Victorian doctors who have recently graduated from Monash University and the University of Melbourne respectively 👩‍🎓👨‍🎓. Emily is currently a medical intern with Monash Health, and Daniel is a general medicine registrar with Eastern Health👩‍⚕️👨‍⚕️. They have gathered to share their best tips on how to tackle the impending challenges of end-of-year medical school written exams and OSCEs🤓, and engage in some wholesome banter along the way 😜</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>1️⃣ What was the best exam result you have achieved since starting medical school, and what do you think contributed to that result?</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text><b>DANIEL:</b> Probably my MD2 exam was my best result. What worked well for me was that I had a good study group – we all just smashed our exam study hard every day and it didn’t feel like as much of a chore when you did it together with a whole bunch of people. We had a vibe where everyone pushed one another, and we connected well enough that we didn’t want to kill each other while studying together. Being a rural cohort removed from the rest of Melbourne, we had an underdog mentality and felt that we had to push really, really hard. It was a pleasant surprise when we found that we had all nailed the exams. 😍</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>It was the year where Melbourne put up a curriculum of things you needed to know, so I just picked up every condition on the curriculum and learned everything I could on each of those conditions – radiology, pathophysiology, history, examination findings, investigations, management, everything. When I got to the exams it all fell into place.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text><b>EMILY:</b> I guess the best result from studying really hard for exams isn’t the exam result itself; it’s the knowledge you have gained that you can now use in your work and life. 🤓‍</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text><b>DANIEL:</b> You don’t think about it this way when you’re a medical student, but your (medical student exam) scores are like VCE: the (exam) scores get you into an internship somewhere and it then becomes irrelevant for the rest of your life. What matters in the end is the knowledge you have gained that you need as a doctor when you are managing patients and their illnesses. Of course there are always more irrelevant things that the uni makes you learn - pathology for example - that you put in your brain just for the exam. Afterwards you can use whatever brand of whiskey you need to get that out of your brain. 🥃</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>2️⃣ If you had OSCEs in a month’s time, how would you prepare for them?</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text><b>EMILY:</b> I would recruit other people who are hopefully going through the same thing and (in a friendly, congenial manner) bully them into joining my study schedule religiously. Then we would all compile OSCE stations - it’s good to have a rich flow of information between everyone. I guess most universities will have a pool of previous exams and resources; get your hands on those and don’t be sitting outside that pool.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Go through the resources and set up proper OSCE stations. Don’t laugh through them. Act like it’s the real thing. It’s helpful to have an adjudicator to keep time when there’s an odd person out. Get the flow of the each clinical examination right because that’s the most difficult and useful thing to master.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text><b>DANIEL:</b> Everything is much better as a group. I lived in dorms and so we would just come into each other’s rooms after lectures were done for the day. We’d pick a system - for example cardiovascular - and we would keep going at it until we got it down to muscle memory. Someone would throw signs at you, and you would eventually get good at putting the pieces together while doing the exam and make a reasonable diagnosis at the end.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I mean OSCEs aren’t that hard. The bit that is tricky is not falling to bits with nerves on the day. The key to that is just muscle memory. All of your exams have to be so slick that when you are really distracted and sweaty and sleep deprived because you couldn’t sleep at all the night before and didn’t have breakfast that morning, you can just into autopilot. All you’re doing on the day is putting the signs together while you’re in autopilot.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Also remember that common is common, especially at the medical student level. If you get asked to do a respiratory exam, it’ll probably be COPD and not something too weird and wonderful. Just remember the common things well.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>The best thing you can do for OSCES is to get into the hospital, peel off after rounds, and find and examine all the patients with signs. Otherwise you will get out of medical school and be hearing wheeze for the first time. You don’t want to be in that spot.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>3️⃣ How would you prepare for a set of written exams?</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text><b>DANIEL:</b> You can get away with a bit more solo time with written exams, whereas for OSCEs you really want to do it with someone who can give you direct feedback. It’s really good to do it in groups of three where you rotate roles and learn from all three perspectives. For written exams it’s great having a study group for the motivational vibes and picking up little bits of knowledge that you didn’t realise you were lacking.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text><b>EMILY:</b> Also with written exams, if you get something wrong you can make a little database of all the questions you get wrong and go through them again at a later stage as as a separate question bank. You know then that you can get them right if they come up on the actual written exam.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>4️⃣ How do you deal with on-the-day exam nerves?</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text><b>EMILY:</b> You just go into autopilot. There’s not much you can do once you get in whatever mental zone you get into on the day.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text><b>DANIEL:</b> Best thing to do, especially if there’s a practical component, is to train it into autopilot as much as you can. But if you can, eat a good breakfast and get a good night’s sleep beforehand.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Also don’t forget to exercise. Everyone always said that to me as a student, and I would just say, “Yeah, great point, but I need to study.” But it actually makes a really big difference to your concentration levels: both when you’re studying, and on the day. If you're physically fit you’re going to be a lot more confident. 🏃</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text><b>EMILY:</b> Don’t psych yourself out too much. Don’t put the blinkers on. You can always remove yourself from the situation. This is just for one or two hours, and then I’m going to be out in the sun for whatever. ☀️</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text><b>JEFFERSON:</b> I’ll add another tip - make sure your head is completely clear coming into the exams. What I always used to do before exams was to take time time right before the exam start time to do a breathing exercise. I would count to maybe 100 breaths, so that I could clear my mind of any distracting thoughts. That way you’re completely calm and focused, and 100% in the moment for the entire duration of the actual exam.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>The second thing that has worked with me is to visualise yourself succeeding at the exam for the entire month leading up to the exam. Olympic performers do the same thing - I’ve read that gold medalists dream about and visualise themselves winning the gold medal for years before they went and did it. You can apply the same practice to exams. I’ve found that persistent visualisation makes a noticeable difference in your confidence levels, and drives you to make the correct day-to-day decisions (e.g. get proper sleep, not procrastinate, eat well, etc) that lead to exam success.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text><b>DANIEL:</b> Fair enough. Relaxation techniques, mindfulness, all that stuff is pretty handy. Even during the exams just be mindful of your stress levels and if you feel that you’re going off the rails, it might be worth that 30 seconds out of your writing time to just stop, take a few deep breaths, destress a little, and then get back into it.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>When you’re going between OSCE stations, don’t take the last OSCE station’s memories over to the next station. Leave it behind and move on with a clean, crisp and fresh mind.✨</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text><b>JEFFERSON:</b> It’s okay if things don’t go perfectly according to plan. Most likely they’re not, and you’ll have questions that throw you off on initial glance. But you have got to have that confidence that no matter what happens, you can make it work. 💪</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>5️⃣ What has been your most memorable exam experience?</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text><b>EMILY:</b> My most memorable exam memory was right before our VIA which is the most important exam in our entire curriculum. One of my friends got stung in the face by a bee 🐝. The poor girl. It got her right between the eyes and her whole face became completely swollen up. 🤕 But she just went straight in (to the exam hall), smashed that exam like an absolute champion, and came out. It was crazy.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n        </Blog.TextBlock>\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\nimport { Blog } from '../../components';\n\nexport default function exam_edition_2() {\n    return (\n        <Blog.TextBlock>\n            <Blog.Author>Interviewed and written by Jefferson Tang</Blog.Author>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Text>Meet Emily Warton and Daniel Hynes, two friendly Victorian doctors who have recently graduated from Monash University and the University of Melbourne respectively 👩‍🎓👨‍🎓.

I’m sympathetic to the forces that were pulling me towards Macca’s and away from studying. We would regularly drive out of town 15-minutes away from the student accommodation to visit the local Macca’s, actually one time we visited that Macca’s three times in one day. I regret doing that. But I did start an exercise regime for the first time in my life that year, which was good. I could give myself a gold star for that.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I wish I studied more, especially in the years where people said, ‘this year doesn’t count.’ If you treat those years like they ‘don’t count’, you then have a shaky foundation for the following year. You should just study all the way through.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text><b>DANIEL:</b>: I guess it’s always easier to find things to criticise yourself for, rather than things to pat yourself on the back for. I’m struggling to think of anything to pat myself on the back for. I guess I did a good job turning up to lectures.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>General advice would be, don’t treat med school like it’s some finite thing where you’re going to get to the end of it, stop studying, and everything will be fine and rosy. Now is the time to start building those study habits, because you’re going to be studying for the rest of your medical career.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>A good habit to get into is to regularly sit down after a ward round and go ‘these are the things I didn’t know, I’m going to go and look them up. I’m not going to do it tomorrow. I’m going to do it tonight and I’m going to make sure I understand it. Then tomorrow I’ll look back and double check that I remember it.’</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I think the big trick to winning in med school and beyond is just being time effective. Ideally you would regiment time for study, time for exercise, time for extracurricular activities - it can be volunteering for some outreach group, or being a research assistant, anything you’re interested in and can fit time for. You can also fit in time to get really hammered or whatever floats your boat.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>If you start budgeting your time now, you’ll find that when things get busy you’ve already got those habits on autopilot. Because if you play your cards well, you can come out of medical school with a fantastic hand: some useful connections with senior clinicians, a few research papers in the pipeline, and a start on something exciting like a podcast. Or you could study really hard, get an amazing Z score that becomes redundant as soon as you get your intern job, and have a blank CV. Those are the two different directions in which you can go.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>My advice is, don’t do what <b>DANIEL:</b> did which was get an average score and nothing on the CV. Try and spread yourself around a little bit, and be organised.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>7️⃣ How do you deal with working full-time and studying for exams at the same time?</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text><b>DANIEL:</b>: You have got to actually get joy out of learning new and interesting things all the time, and you have to fit the rest of your life around it. Even once you get to the other side of your current exams, it doesn’t stop. It’s not like you are finished with your exams once and for all, and the medicine you need to learn never progresses beyond there. There are always new things that you have to learn and know, and you always have to allocate a bit of of your personal time to study, as well as to other medical things, and of course to your friends, family and own wellbeing. None of that really changes throughout your career, maybe just the relative ratios.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>This will surprise you, but medical school is probably the least busy you will be throughout your career. If you can smash out some of the things now that you would have to do later on in your career anyway, then you're playing the system very well. Because you can either work on those research projects now, or you can work on them while you’re doing 50 hour work-weeks.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>8️⃣ How do you take care of your health and relationships during the exam lockdown period, and also in times when you have lot of things on your plate?</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text><b>EMILY:</b> Don’t take out your stress on anyone else.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text><b>DANIEL:</b>: This is where time budgeting is important. Putting yourself into an absolute lockdown mode and never seeing your friends, family or loved one is not healthy. You will actually do worse in the long run if you do that. You need a break every so often. If you find that you keep pausing to play Dota (or some other video game or procrastination activity), it means that you’re a bit cooked (from all the study) and maybe you need to study a bit less and spend a bit more time with your loved ones. Make your study time count and make your spare time count.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Don’t lose your temper at people you care about if you’re having a bad time from the exam study. Bite your tongue for a second, take a deep breath, and tell them ‘sorry I’m very stressed and these are the reasons.’</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text><b>EMILY:</b> People will understand. You’re doing medical school and you’re going through some intense exams. They will understand that you won’t be present very much. Just don’t get carried away with the momentum of how stressed you are and let it negatively impact your relationships. Always feel free to share your feelings with other people because that’s the best thing you can do.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text><b>DANIEL:</b>: It took me a long time to actually believe that regular exercise and keeping fit will help you be much more sharp on the actual exam day. It also makes a massive difference to how effectively you study. It’s very tempting to say no, I’ll put in my five hours of study and the length of time I spend studying is what matters. But in reality, if you go for a run and then sit down to study afterwards, you’ll make the hour-long (or however long) study session count for so much more. The mental crispness you get just after exercise helps you make leaps in your exam study journey, whereas you’ll be like a cripple hobbling on crutches on your exam study journey without regular exercise.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>The exams never stop and everything only gets harder once you start working. You’ll burn out quickly if you sacrifice your health and relationships for the sake of exam study.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>9️⃣ If your results end up being worse than anticipated, or if you end up failing, what is the best way to cope and respond?</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text><b>EMILY:</b> I think talking to someone about it is the starting point. Trying to figure out if you fail, how can you sort it out and move forward with your goals. Hopefully the university is supportive of your situation and they’ll give you the information early on. It’s quite structured and you don’t have to fly around trying to figure out things for yourself. And try not to take it too personally.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text><b>DANIEL:</b>: Everyone always stresses about failing uni exams. However there is a strong financial incentive for the university to pass you. You are probably going to end up all right.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>In the off chance that you fail, it’s a game. Don’t take it personally because there is no such thing as a perfect exam where you are fairly assessed on how good you are as a medical student or as a doctor or whatever.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Have people you can talk to about it; people that you can trust.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>You can go one of two ways after you suffer a ‘exam failure’: you can either go on a big negative spiral of ‘I’ve had a shit time so I’m going to get really blind drunk for a while and I’m not going to do much. Maybe I’ll tell my girlfriend that she ruined everything and it’s her fault. Or you can go the other way and say, ‘All right, I failed and I feel really inadequate about how good I am. So I’m going to study even harder, I’m going to go for that run, I’m going to eat really well and I’m going to sleep as well as I can. The only way to get over feeling inadequate about failing an exam is to do some things that make you feel like you’re a bit of a winner.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text><b>EMILY:</b> People fail all the time in every domain of life. Especially in medical school when you’ve got these exams, you just focus on the next thing in front of you and you’re not seeing the hundreds of things behind you. Everyone around you has failed in multiple things.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Your seniors have failed. If you fail now, it will mean that you take something from the experience and you won’t fail in the future where your peers will.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text><b>DANIEL:</b>: It’s character building. In the b=ig scheme of things, even if you’re an ‘old’ Melbourne postgrad, I promise that by the time you’re a consultant, you’ll still be super young if you just blast through (the whole training path) without ever stopping. Once you hit that point, there’s nowhere else to go. So don’t rush. Take your time. Learn what you need to learn, make the mistakes you need to make and learn from them. Don’t feel too bad about it, it’s all a part of life.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text><b>EMILY:</b> I think the hard and scary thing for a lot of people is other people finding out that they failed. Your one exam failure doesn’t reflect on you as a person. I think it’s all about keeping perspective that people fail all the time and this is just a single event. In the future, if one of your peers fails, they will hold themselves completely accountable for it. They won’t be thinking of your failure, they will instead blow their own failure out of proportions. Your failure is just a blip in everyone else’s mind, and is really massive to you. Don’t worry too much about what other people are thinking about you, because it’s always so much more important to you than it is to them.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text><b>DANIEL:</b>: It’s super true, we’re all terrible at dealing with failure. We all define our ideas of whether we are successful people or not a bit too much by how we are doing in medicine, which is not entirely valid. You need to keep in mind that although you might not have passed an exam, you need to look at the broader picture and think about all the other things in life that you’re winning at.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>🔟 What pleasures can you allow yourself during the exam lockdown period?</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text><b>DANIEL:</b>: Enjoy the things that are good for you as much as you can. Enjoy delicious, succulent meals. Enjoy sleeping, and enjoy exercise - actually enjoy it, it shouldn’t be a chore.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>You can still allow yourself some time to have fun hanging out with your mates.

I realised I wasn’t happy about it and I decided to do something about it. So at age 15 I decided to remake myself into a stronger, more social and more self-confident version of myself.\n                My evolution had some benefits in meeting more people. It was a fantastic period in the 1960s (when Michael was in high school, and also the era of ‘sex, drugs, and rock ’n’ roll’) and through meeting lots of people I ended up managing bands. One of the bands was called Peanut Butter Conspiracy - they were never anything remarkable but we used to run gigs around town and had a lot of great times. The more people I knew and the more bands I managed, the more friends I had. I never looked back after that and it gave me a lot of self-confidence which I didn’t have at a younger age.\n                I became known as a natural leader and became a prefect at my high school. I went to Normanhurst Boys’ High School (a selective school in Sydney). I used to be president of my local youth group and in the Jewish circle. Throughout my life, people have approached me to take on things and lead things. I can honestly say that save for one occasion, I’ve never actually formally applied for any position that I’ve had.\n            </i>\n            </Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>IT’S IMPORTANT TO ENGAGE WITH PEOPLE WELL, NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO IN LIFE</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>If people want to succeed in medicine or business or anything really in life, you’ve got to be engaging with people. You’ve got to like people.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>There’s an adage about who gets the jobs in medicine, and it’s not the most skilful person or the one with the highest marks. It’s about availability, affability and ability - in that order.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I have been on selection panels for people applying for medical jobs. They have got to be A.) available and not mucking around, and B.) be people that you want to work with every day; Nice people that you can relax and have a joke with. Ability is very important but that comes third. The first two traits are more important.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Communication is very important in life and your profession.

I was always going to be a surgeon. I trained as a medical student and intern at the Royal North Shore hospital. I was doing a rotation in Mona Vale and I got on really well with a couple of the senior surgeons from Sydney Hospital there at Mona Vale. They told me, “Come to Sydney Hospital next year and you’ll get on the surgical training program.” So I applied to Sydney Hospital and got onto the surgical training scheme. I stayed for a couple of years and did a bit of advanced surgical training, including a term as a surgical registrar up in Tamworth. I decided that I didn’t like it, and at that time I was getting on really well with the anaesthetist.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I concluded that surgeons really only did two or three procedures. No matter what speciality, they specialised in two or three procedures. God forbid you should be a colonoscopist, you’d be doing that for the rest of your life.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I then took a year off and during that year off I found a job posting in the Sydney Morning Herald for the position of relieving casualty director at Parramatta Hospital. The casualty coordinator was taking six months long service leave. I was interested so I applied for it and I got it. This was the one and only formal job application that I have done in my life and I got it.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I started in early January of 1977, and a few days later we had the Granville train disaster where a train derailed and crashed into a street bridge in Sydney with countless severe casualties. Parramatta was the closest major hospital, so I was suddenly in charge of this major trauma event.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Apparently I did all right because I was approached by all these anaesthetists afterwards who told me “You’ve got a great career ahead of you. You should do anaesthetics. Westmead Hospital is opening next year and we’d like you to apply for one of the anaesthetic jobs.” So I followed their advice: I completed my one year term in Parramatta Hospital and then around August Westmead Hospital - a brand-new large teaching hospital - opened. The Director of Anaesthetics and two of the other senior anaesthetic consultants all backed me into an anaesthetics job: There were 74 applicants and four openings, and I got one of them. The rest of history.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>THIS SOUNDS TERRIBLE, BUT ONE OF THE BEST ATTRIBUTES OF A SUCCESSFUL TRAUMA DOCTOR OR ANAESTHETIST IS A LACK OF EMPATHY</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>If you get too emotionally involved in disasters, you can’t function at your optimum level. Whereas if you can step back and analyse a situation and do what is necessary, you will achieve better outcomes. What follows is that you are perceived to be more skilful and in control, and people will look to you as a leader. I joke about it all the time with all the surgeons I work with regularly that I’m not very strong in the empathy department.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>It’s not to say that I’m not empathetic in my personal life but I could probably be better. I mean the price of all the things that I have done and do is that I have been divorced twice. Personal relationships get put on the bench when you are doing so many other things.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>On the job it’s an advantage that you’re able to step back and look at the overall picture, rather than get preoccupied with a single ‘factor’ like the injured family of a mother, three children and a dog for example. You end up getting swept away by the emotional aspects of things rather than doing your best to stop her from dying.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Empathy, you either have it or you don’t. I don’t have it unfortunately. I’ve never had it and it probably cost me in my personal relationships. But it’s been a great advantage to me in my professional life.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>EVERYONE MAKES MISTAKES IN THEIR CLINICAL PRACTICE. NO-ONE GETS IT RIGHT 100% OF THE TIME</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>We’re all flawed individuals. There are always things that you look back on and thinking, ‘Well I should have played that differently.’ You can be self-critical but you shouldn’t let it get out of hand. You don’t want to beat yourself over your mistakes too much. I think everyone will make mistakes in whatever career they pursue; everyone will encounter near-misses and disasters.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I was counselling a few registrars about this a couple of Fridays ago. As long as you perform to your utmost and tried as hard as you could in the pursuit of your desired outcome, you should not beat yourself hard about it, particularly if the result was satisfactory. You should actually be quite happy and proud if it was a near miss but you fixed it. Otherwise you’re going to become depressed and you won’t be able to function. The constant sense of inadequacy is one of the reasons why particularly in anaesthetics, critical care medicine and dentistry, suicide rates are particularly high.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>You have got to be proud of what you have achieved in your journey and learn from any mistakes you learn along the way. Young doctors are inevitably going to make a lot of mistakes. I sure did in my younger days, I can’t recall the exact mistakes I made but I’m sure I made many of them. The trick is to recognise them, recover from them and learn from them. If you can do that consistently then you’ll become a great doctor.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>THE POLITICS OF HOSPITAL JOB SELECTION</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>The medical training system is much tougher now than what I experienced when I was going through.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I’ve been involved with selection panels and you’re often not allowed to choose all the best people. Rather you categorise candidates into three broad groups: the top academic group, the middle group, and those that we have to give a job to but we don’t have high expectations of. You’re not allowed to choose all the best people and every hospital is meant to employ applicants from each group, however not all hospitals stick to the rules. Also, hospitals sometimes have applicants they are intending to preference before the job positions are even advertised. The point is that just because you miss out on a certain position doesn’t mean to say you’re a terrible candidate. Often it’s not your fault and are other factors at play.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>The trick is, keep trying. Try again next year.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO GET YOUR REFEREES RIGHT</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>As you progress through your career you’ll make a great impression on a number of your bosses. As an example, I met a senior resident who really impressed me when I was doing a locum position up in Lismore Base Hospital. She wanted to specialise in intensive care. I’m fairly well known and connected in that world, so I told her “If you want an intensive care position, use me as a referee.” I actually volunteered myself to be their referee. This particular person has now got an intensive care trainee position at a major teaching hospital next year. I not only wrote the reference for her, but I also rang the Director of Intensive Care at this hospital and told them, “This person is really good and you’d be insane not to give them the job.”</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>There are people around like me who will go to that extent in supporting the young doctors that impress us. We certainly remember what it was like when we were young and looking for jobs. If you are an outstanding candidate, we will volunteer to be the referee. If someone ever tells you to use them as a referee or you are working with someone that you know is quite influential, ask them very early (while you’re working them but not when they’re busy with their duties), “I’d like to do X. Will you be a referee for me.” It’s a very useful way to advance your career, assuming of course that you get on with the person and you’re a worthwhile candidate that the referee is</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>NO MATTER HOW OVERCROWDED AND COMPETITIVE MEDICINE GETS, THE TOP PEOPLE ALWAYS GET THE BEST JOBS</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>The top people are not the people with the highest marks. The top people are the ones that worked the hardest, the ones that always gave a little bit extra and stuck around to finish their cases rather than go home just because their shift is done.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>You’d be surprised at how many of the millennial young doctors leave right at the end of their shift. We (the senior doctors) are not particularly impressed with that. What we are impressed with are people who apply themselves and are interested in finishing a job that they started.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Personally, if I am in theatre and they come and ask me if I could come do an extra case because of an acutely unwell patient, I will always say yes unless I have got a good reason not to. In providing that extra service beyond your regular duties, the people you work with come to respect you more. It’s a very flattering thing when the other doctors and the hospital staff ask you to look after them when they are undergoing operations.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I remember when I was just starting out, there was a senior anaesthetist I was working with who would get asked by all the staff to anaesthetise their parents and themselves. I was really jealous and I thought to myself that I wanted to be like him when I’m established. I want to be the go-to guy where the hospital staff come and want me to look after them. I achieved that.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>PET ANNOYANCE - JUNIOR STAFF WHO THINK THEY KNOW IT ALL AND DON’T WANT TO LEARN THINGS FROM MORE SENIOR AND EXPERIENCED PEOPLE</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>All the time you see junior staff doing things that could be done a lot better.

When I talk to a patient I don’t talk as a doctor to the patient, but I actually try and talk to them person-to-person and as an equal. Talk to your patients, find out a bit about what they do and understand the people you’re dealing with. Every patient is different.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>ONE OF THE LESSONS I’VE TRIED TO TEACH BOTH OF MY KIDS - DON’T THINK YOU’RE BETTER THAN EVERYONE ELSE</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>Everyone is the same, so try and understand the people you’re dealing with. Go through the motion of identifying what their issues are and on an equal basis, rather than from the high ground as the doctor. Patients react to that very well and they will tell you things if you talk to them as an equal that they wouldn’t tell you otherwise if you talked to them as if you were a higher species as a specialist doctor.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>YOU REALISE AS A PATIENT ON THE OTHER END, THAT THE ONLY MINOR OPERATION IS ANY OPERATION YOU’RE NOT HAVING YOURSELF</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>It’s always very useful to be a patient yourself occasionally. In the last few years I’ve had my gallbladder out and a few knee arthroscopies. You realise as a patient on the other end, that the only minor operation is any operation you’re not having yourself. The other thing is that no matter how much you know about medicine, as a patient you’re put in a hostile uncontrolled situation. No matter how clever you are, you have no control over the situation you are in.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>One of the things that I’m teaching everyone these days is the importance of communication to patients when there is a delay. Often we send for patients and then everyone decides immediately afterwards, let’s have a cup of tea. So the patient is stuck in the anaesthetic bay.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>All you need to do is go up to them and say, “Can I get you a magazine? I’ve asked the staff to have a quick cup of tea because they’ve been working really hard this morning. Is that alright? We’ll be 20 minutes. Is there anything we can do for you while you’re waiting?” I’ll apologise to the patient for the delay, and they are universally grateful for that communication whereas most of the time people just leave them in the anaesthetic prep room. So they’ll be sitting in the anaesthetic room listening to every sound and imagining that people will come in and attack them with a large needle at any second.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Communicating that the staff is having a short break, while it may seem like a little thing to you or I, is very important to the patient. It’s the little things that are important in life.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n        </Blog.TextBlock>\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\nimport { Blog } from '../../components';\n\nexport default function murray_esler() {\n    return (\n        <Blog.TextBlock>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>**FINAL ETERNAL POSSIBILITIES PUBLICATION FOR 2019</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Author>Interviewed and written by Jefferson Tang</Blog.Author>\n            <Blog.Author>Photographed by Amber Anderson</Blog.Author>\n            ‍<br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Text><i>Professor Murray Esler is the Professor of Medicine at the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute that sits right next to the Alfred Hospital in Melbourne, Victoria.

I decided that my dream was to be a doctor just like him.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I trained in medicine as an undergraduate at the University of Melbourne.

I found that I liked it and subsequently pursued it.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>After two years of clinical training I did a PhD at the ANU in cardiovascular neuroscience. This was almost 50 years ago: the methods were primitive but it involved looking at how the brain and how it influenced high blood pressure. That PhD really got me wedded to cardiovascular medicine. After that I was stationed for four years in a department of hypertension and cardiology in Michigan, USA where I finished my training as a clinical postdoctorate.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>BEING DRIVEN TO THE VERGE OF PANIC DISORDER RIGHT AFTER STARTING IN THE USA</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>The most challenging phase of my career was when I had just started my postdoctorate training in North America. I learned within a few weeks that my boss was going on sabbatical and that I would be running the research program for a year in his place. I was thrown into the deep end and had to survive. This took me to the verge of panic disorder but I recovered. Looking back, I got the opportunity to devise and manage a research program; an opportunity that I may not have had if the boss had been home.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>When the boss - Professor Stevo Julius - returned home he helped me complete my research program and get it published in the New English Journal of Medicine. He is now 90 and a venerated figure internationally in hypertension research. We get on well to this day and he has been an invaluable mentor to me throughout my career. In fact just this year we just recently published a joint research paper together with my doctor daughter.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>He taught me that you have to follow your own dream in science. In medical science there is a tremendous amount of groupthink and trends which are usually unproductive and turn out to be empty science within a few years. My boss followed his own dream and he certainly displayed the virtues of his approach. At the personal level he was a very civilised and compassionate man who treated everyone well. A key professional characteristic he had was that he was extremely honest and tried his best to eliminate his preconceptions and prejudices when it came to his scientific work.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>HOW I DIDN’T PLAN MY CAREER</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>My career decisions were often pretty haphazard and ultimately lucky.

Not many are still doing medical science at 76 as I am. I’ve seen many friends and colleagues become Deans of Medicine and healthcare administrators, all of which are worthy pursuits. For me my core fascination is with the mysteries of human biology, health and disease and trying to solve those puzzles to develop better treatments.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>KEY ADVICE FOR YOUNG DOCTORS AND MEDICAL STUDENTS</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>1️⃣ Use your own eyes and ears and be a free thinker. A lot of ‘knowledge’ in the world is groupthink and fashion, and it doesn’t help you distinguish yourself in the long run. Of course that’s difficult when you’re an undergraduate since certain set answers are expected of you.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>2️⃣ Choosing your discipline within medicine is extremely important for your personal job satisfaction. There are many different ways of being a doctor. You can be a public health administration or you can be a cardiac surgeon who does transplants. Peoples’ temperament tends to make them better at one or the other. For example my daughter has just got a job to return to indigenous healthcare up in Darwin. She was a public health physician and has been working in Melbourne, but the call of the tropics and indigenous health has dragged her back.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>3️⃣ Be selfless when you’re dealing with patients.

It’s all about breaking down cultural barriers and being open to new people, experiences and perspectives. The same applies when you’re studying abroad, especially in this international degree where you meet different people from different backgrounds who have diverse perspectives. It’s really important that you can approach every experience with an open mind and make the most of every opportunity to learn from everyone else.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>There is no way I could do a job where I was sitting in an office by myself all day. One of my biggest passions is  working on interesting projects in teams, often friends. Being able to sit down with a friend and understand what they are thinking and what makes them tick, and acting as the glue for a team and helping the team to function as smoothly as possible, is something that really interests me. An accelerated form of that dynamic is present in a hackathon. The MedHack 2016 hackathon which you participated in was a way to bring together teams of people from different disciplines who hadn’t previously met each other to collaborate on healthcare problems. That’s one of the most intellectually stimulating experiences for me - meeting new people to work on a new problem, where everyone brings something different to the table.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>ON PURSUING AN INTERNATIONAL MBA</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>As I was wrapping up medical school, I started thinking about what I wanted to do later. I really enjoyed working in clinical medicine and seeing patients, however my experience with medical innovation inspired me to try something a little different. So I looked at various MBA programs - particularly overseas - and came across the INSEAD one-year MBA course in France that really excited me. It’s well known for being focused on delivering social impact through business and being a very international business school. From memory the last cohort included about 94 different nationalities. The idea of meeting many different people from all over the world really excited me. It’s also been a stroke of good timing - I have just finished two years of hospital medical practice and I haven’t joined a specialty program yet. I have got my general registration so it’s a good time to take a year off, regroup and see where I want to go to from here.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>In the long term, I see myself pursuing a career in healthcare innovation. In clinical medicine you make a lot of impact on individual patients and their families and that can be really rewarding. But for me I’ve always wanted to have a wider impact through the work that I do. Working in teams on long-term projects in addition to working on my traditional career has always really excited me. I think my medical degree and experience help me to understand the healthcare landscape, and my MBA will empower me with entrepreneurial and management skills to lead teams in healthcare innovation.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>There are so many different possibilities with what we can do with the MBA and that makes it very exciting. For me I know that I've come from the healthcare industry, and I know that I want to go back to the healthcare industry. It's really just about what kind of role I want to play. Realistically there are two main areas I could end up: number one is working in healthcare innovation potentially in a business strategy position, alternatively it would be great to step into healthcare management.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>MASSIVE OPEN ONLINE COURSES (MOOCS) ARE A GREAT AVENUE TO PICK UP NEW SKILLS</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>When you’re going through medical school, the concept of lifelong learning and maintaining strong self-education habits is preached ad nauseam as being critical for a successful medical career. That line of thinking carries over to websites like Coursera and edX. These Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are widely available and provide a really good opportunity for people to pick up new skills and to get a taste for topics, careers and industries that they wouldn’t be exposed to through their day-to-day work. They are really good means to decentralise high-quality education and make it a lot more accessible. I’ve personally done courses in machine learning, data science, maths, global health and languages. I think it’s a good way to interact with people who are normally outside your professional sphere.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>ON FINDING AND COMMITTING TO EXCITING EXTRACURRICULAR OPPORTUNITIES</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>Some of them came by chance and some by design. Most medical school programs have limited or no exposure to important pockets of the healthcare world such as medical innovation, medical devices, the pharmaceutical industry and global health. It’s understandable that medical schools tend to focus less on these realms, but it can be a bit of a shame that young students aren’t exposed to more diverse opportunities.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>It’s really by chance that I found out about all these different medical innovation opportunities in Australia: through both my medical research job, and then also because some friends and I decided that we wanted to work on a project we were really passionate about - the digital health project in malaria diagnostics.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>A question that a lot of people have asked me is if I have ever worried about extracurricular activities impacting on my day-to-day roles as a medical student or junior doctor - my answer is usually no. Medical school grades and academic isn’t everything; having a good breadth of experience in understanding how people work and being able to work well in teams is infinitely more important than knowing a set of specific facts, especially in a world where we have instantaneous access to decentralised databases like UpToDate.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Having a good balance between the four pillars of academics, social life, extracurriculars and sleep is difficult but it’s possible. It’s not something that I manage to get right all the time. In this regard I look up to one of my mentors who I have been fortunate to have for the last seven years, Rinaldo Bellomo. He is one of the most published doctors of all time in Australia and New Zealand, and he is real shining example of how you can balance it really well and have a good family life, good academic life and good professional life.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING OPEN-MINDED</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I think it’s very easy for doctors sailing into a hierarchical work environment to become close-minded in two main ways.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>The first is in terms of career pathway: a commonly-held view is that it is a conveyor belt from medical school to residency to specialty training to fellowship to professorship. Medicine is so much broader than that, and there are so many other options: being a clinician-researcher, global health, public health, ethics, medical administration and management to name a few. Those options all use skills and knowledge learnt in medical school.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>The second is the way you perceive the workplace hierarchy in hospitals. Classically there are set roles: the students are at the bottom of the pile, the junior doctors are in the middle, and then the registrars and consultants are heaped on top. I think it’s really important to keep in mind that everyone has something to learn from each other. Once you become an intern you find out that the nurses are actually very friendly and helpful people who have the same goals as you and who you work closely with. Asking for their advice and learning from them is key, because many of them have more practical experience than we do as brand new doctors. One of the key tips that I tell my medical students is to learn everyone’s names - that’s incredibly important.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n        </Blog.TextBlock>\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\nimport { Blog } from '../../components';\n\nexport default function ian_harris() {\n    return (\n        <Blog.TextBlock>\n            <Blog.Author>Interviewed and written by Christopher Erian</Blog.Author>\n            ‍<br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Text>\n            <i>\n                Professor Harris is a Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery at the University of New South Wales.

To be human is to be faced with two events and naturally want to link them together. So for example if somebody presents to you with back pain, you do an MRI scan and that scan shows something: it could be a dehydrated disc or a small annular tear or whatever, it's a normal human response to associate those two. You see someone in pain and you find something, you immediately think that those two are causally related.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>That's a very human thing to do and that's been built into our logic circuits over evolution, over hundreds of thousands of years. It's a logical shortcut and it actually makes us seem very smart, but sometimes it's wrong. This is the problem. And what happens is people often get better anyway. A lot of people get better from a lot of things.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>In surgery, it's very difficult to convince people otherwise. Using bloodletting as an example, it was only when doctors started looking at the evidence in an objective, scientific way that they found that it actually was not effective. But the physicians who had been using it had seen thousands of patients get better after bloodletting, so you can imagine their reluctance to let that go. That’s the problem: they were being human, they weren't being scientific.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>And sometimes these things take a generation or more to change…</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I see a lot of young surgeons who have been in practice for only a few years who get it, who really understand how it works and how we have to pay attention to this kind of evidence. They’re also aware of their own biases. Just because a patient got better doesn't mean they got better because of what I did. Would they have gotten better anyway? They can find that out by looking at some of these trials.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>What is the 'Wobbly Triad' and how do we negate its influence in the literature?</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>The Wobbly Triad are three factors that are used to support a lot of surgeries: They’ll find a biologically plausible mechanism, they’ll try it out on some patients and it will seem to work, and they will find laboratory evidence. To me, it's not enough: they do not prove causation. The only way to do that is to divide patients up randomly and do it on some people and don't do it on others. Sounds pretty simple, but that is rarely done.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>The first leg of the triad is a biologically plausible mechanism. Now it’s important to have a biologically plausible mechanism for the treatment that you're proposing. The trouble is if you do have one, it doesn’t necessarily mean that your treatment works. It’s not good enough to just have a biologically plausible mechanism, because you can make up a biologically plausible mechanism for almost anything you want.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>The second leg of the tripod is observational evidence. This is basically saying, “we did it on some people and they seem to get better.” You could do that for the common cold and you'd get 100% success rate, so observational evidence doesn't mean it works.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>And the third one is lab evidence. Lab research is overrated - we look at it as ‘the purest research.’ It’s not. It's all over place. Lab research is really not that good. There's a lot of error in it; there's a lot of small numbers; there's a lot of unreasonable inference going on.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>My practice has changed enormously from what my first 10 years…</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I used to do a lot of spine fusions, knee scopes and stuff like that because I thought they worked. I don't do them anymore. I stopped doing spine surgery when I started looking at the evidence.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>It wasn't so much the PhD (that prompted this change), it was really the Master's. A lot of people say, \"If you do a PhD then you're a good researcher.\" I would respond that the Masters of Clinical Epidemiology did much more to help my research skills than the PhD. It was the Master’s that taught me the core research skills, and the PhD that allowed me to hone those skills.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>Why Orthopaedics?</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I’ve always been interested in science - I was the geeky kid at school who loved physics and maths. Logical puzzles have always been appealing to me. Orthopaedic surgery is full of mechanical problems. My dad was an engineer and best handyman in the world. He could build anything and solve any mechanical problem. I was never nearly as good as him, but that influence led me into orthopaedics.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>And within orthopaedics I was drawn to trauma, because then you're literally putting the jigsaw puzzle back together again, and putting plates and screws and nails in to hold it in place.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Not many people were doing trauma orthopaedics at that time. It wasn't really attractive because people wanted to do joint replacements, sports medicine, shoulders - these are the glossier specialties - but I just love doing trauma.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>One of my things is trying to make the world a little more scientific</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>In surgery you get into a ‘groove’. I'd come home late at night after operating all day, crash in front of the TV, watch Law and Order, and that was my life. But I always wanted to do more: I wanted to be a better scientist and let that flow into becoming a better surgeon. That led me into clinical epidemiology and research, and then into trying to promote that.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Nowadays I'm a member of a few societies that promote scientific thought and critical thinking, and try to block the pseudoscience that's out there. A lot of universities capitalise on pseudoscience and have these crazy degrees in things that are stupid, and so we push against that. I think everyone needs to be a bit more scientific - I think it'll make for a better world.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>I toyed with a couple of other specialties when I was a student, like everybody does</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>Back in my junior days I was also interested in anatomical and forensic pathology. But then I did an elective in my final year which really sold me on orthopaedics. I went to Apia, the capital city of Samoa. At the time there were not a lot of specialists there and it was mostly pretty low-level medicine, but there was a French-Vietnamese orthopaedic surgeon from Germany there. I was told, \"Well, you can work with this guy if you want?\" I said, \"Oh yeah, it sounds all right. Yeah, I might do that.\"</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>This guy was phenomenal. He did amazing things with limited resources. We didn't have an image intensifier in the theatres, so he had to work out ways of fixing things without x-ray, had limited implants and he just taught me absolutely heaps in the few months that I was there. I was just infected by his enthusiasm and knowledge, so I thought, \"Oh yeah, I think orthopaedic is for me.\"</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Interestingly a lot of junior residents and interns get influenced by the people they work with rather than the specialty itself. If you do a couple of good terms with some orthopaedic surgeons in a unit that's fun, where everyone gets along and they take you under their wing and look after you, that's a very positive reinforcement. You're going to want to do orthopaedics after that.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I was lucky. My intern year was during The Dispute: between 1984 to 1988 in New South Wales the orthopaedic surgeons weren't operating in the public hospitals. So the orthopaedic registrar had nothing to do and he took me under his wing. We did some closed reductions in the emergency department and stuff like that. He was a very funny guy and he's now a very senior orthopod. I was very influenced by him and other people I'd worked with that made me want to do orthopaedics.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>I'll give you one piece of advice that was given to me when I was an intern…</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I was working at this hospital as an intern, and at lunchtime you go to the RMOs room where the residents and registrars just hang out and chat. And as I was an intern, people often ask you, \"What do you want to do?\" I remember saying at the time, \"Well, I'm kind of interested in orthopaedic surgery but I'm not sure whether I'll end up doing it.\" And they asked, \"Why not?\" I replied, \"Because it's too hard to get into. \" And they all laughed at me. And they said, \"If you want to do something, you'll do it. Don't not do it because it's too hard.\" And I thought, \"Oh, that's interesting.\"</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>Having seen countless people come after me, if you want to do something bad enough you'll do it</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>You'll do what's needed to get in. You'll do the exams, you'll pass them. I know that some people don't get to do what they wanted, but you'd be surprised. By far the majority do.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>So my advice is if you are particularly passionate about one particular area and you want to do it, just go for it and do it. If you're not that keen on it then maybe think about something else because the good thing about medicine is you can do almost anything. There's so much scope for you to travel. I've got a lot of friends that joined the military and other friends who are doctors on cruise ships. Some people I know just do research and don't do any clinical work at all; they really enjoy that. There's all sorts of things you can do, the world is your oyster if you're an intern right now. Just pick what you want to do.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>Don’t sweat the small stuff. Things will work out if you're halfway sensible</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I had a very fortunate path through life: I got into medicine, got through medicine without any trouble, got all the jobs I wanted to get as an intern and resident, and then got into orthopaedics.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I didn't get into orthopaedics straight away, I don't want you to think I'm a wunderkind. It took me three attempts to get into the orthopaedic training scheme, which is more than usual: most people get in on the first or second attempt. On my second attempt I was ranked as first reserve, so I'd just missed out. I remember everybody consoling me saying, \"Oh too bad. Don't take it too hard. Don't get depressed.\" And I'm like, \"I'm not depressed, I was first reserve, that's really good. That means I should get on next year if I continue to play my cards right.\" I wasn't worried about it at all.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>The year after I did get on, and I remember the person who was first reserve that time was completely dejected and thought, \"Oh my God, my life's over.\" And I'm like, \"What are you on about? You'll get on next year.\" And he did.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>Another philosophy I've worked out is that nothing is all bad</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I have had significant setbacks and I remember that feeling in the pit of your stomach which makes you think, \"I've screwed up. I've done this wrong.\" But I've always been able to come out of it on the other side. There's always something you can learn out of it. When these setbacks occur and things don't go your way, you have to think, \"There's got to be something I can learn from that. Some good will come from that.\" It sounds corny, like the saying that ‘every cloud has a silver lining’.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>But that's the way I've done it. You come out at the other end. Being able to see yourself in a few months' time out of it, and knowing that you've done it before and you'll do it again is very helpful. What has really helped me through setbacks is thinking, \"Well, that's okay. I've learned from this and I know I'll get out of it. I feel like crap at the moment, but I know that in the near future I won't.\"</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>Connect with Prof. Harris:</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>@DoctorDoubter</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Prof Harris’ book, Surgery: The Ultimate Placebo is essential reading for any doctor or patient alike.

The biggest problem that we can tackle is that there is a reluctance in people that have hearing loss to do anything about it; It’s much easier and cheaper to get your wife and children to talk louder so that you can hear them. The reason that we call ourselves a profit-for-purpose company is that we don’t want people to have to rely on a charity. It’s fair for them to pay for a solution to their hearing loss. However we don’t exist just to make a profit, we funnel those profits into researching better solutions and growing the company to provide better and more affordable solutions.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>In my opinion hearing loss is more of a social problem than a medical problem, but it’s treated more like a medical problem. That is one of the reasons why it’s expensive. The government realised this quite a long time ago and so there’s a government scheme to provide free hearing aids to people who can’t afford them. However that only helps out about half of the people that use hearing aids; there’s still 75% of hearing loss victims who should be using hearing aids who aren’t using them at all and aren’t addressed by the government scheme.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>HEARING AIDS SHOULD BECOME ATTRACTIVE ACCESSORIES</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>People have a natural reluctance to come and see an audiologist in a clinic because it’s admitting, “I’ve got a clinical problem and I’m looking for a clinical solution.” Actually wearing hearing aids is something that ought to be as accepted as wearing glasses. I notice Amber is wearing glasses but nobody thinks Amber has got a disability. I wear glasses as well. I'd really like to see hearing as accepted in the same way that glasses are accepted. One of the big problems is that hearing aids are a lot more expensive than glasses.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>There are some initiatives in other countries to make hearing aids cheaper and to make them available over the counter than requiring you to see an audiologist. I think that’s a move in the right direction provided that the hearing aids can actually be fitted properly to the person. It’s not quite the same as going to the optometrist and trying five different pairs of glasses until you find the ones that work the best. It’s not as easy to tell which hearing aids are going to fit the best and you need to try a lot more than five different types to do that properly. That’s where our speech perception test and our method of helping people to fit their hearing aids themselves may be useful.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>We have tried to address the problem of the size and shape of hearing aids. It’s not an easy to get somebody to actually like their hearing aid – the shape and look of it – to the point where they’re happy to tell other people that they are wearing hearing aids. We have come some way towards addressing that. That hearing aid you see on the picture on the wall is called the Facett and it was designed here in Melbourne by Leah Heiss who calls herself a medical device jewelry designer. We’re trying to change the perception of hearing aids – we want to become an attractive accessory that you put on daily. We would like people to say, “That’s a nice hearing aid that you’re wearing” just as they might compliment the frames of your glasses.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>IN THE FUTURE PEOPLE MAY BE ABLE TO USE THEIR HEARING AIDS TO CONTROL HOME APPLIANCES OR MAKE PHONE CALLS</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>The big trend nowadays is that hearing aids are increasingly becoming connected to the Internet, either through your phone or a Bluetooth connection. This opens up a new realm of possibilities – in the future people may be able to use their hearing aid to control home appliances or make phone calls. Unfortunately from my point of view that will make hearing aids more expensive because once they start to have phone functionality it’s adding a lot to the device complexity. There are also increasingly more devices that can feed information into a hearing aid via a wireless link. An example is a university lecture and you’re sitting at the back of the class, you can place a microphone close to the lecturer and have your own private wireless signal going direct to your hearing aids.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>A hearing aid is not just a sound amplifier. Hearing aids these days have directional microphones built in, and have noise reduction algorithms to make them less susceptible to wind noise and those sorts of things. The amplification is the primary function but being able to reprogram them or select different settings for different conditions is now standard. It’s like a small computer and the impressive part is that the small computer runs for a week on a battery the size of your fingernail. I don’t think there’s another computer like that anywhere in the world.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>PEOPLE CAN DIAGNOSE THEIR HEARING LOSS EARLY USING A FIVE-MINUTE ONLINE TEST</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I’d love everybody to do hearing tests at home: You can do it as many times as you like, and you have a record of what your hearing was like on a particular day. There’s 32 different lists of words and they’re presented in a random order. You’re never going to be able to memorize the word sequence and hence cheat the test. The test tells you how many words you got correct and how many words you got wrong – it’s different from usual hearing test. This test will tell you how serious your hearing deficiencies are and you can decide whether you want to get a hearing aid and whether it will help you. I think it’s good because it helps people understand how their hearing loss might be affecting their lives.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>People can now do their initial hearing test from the comfort of their own homes. They just have to go to the website and do a five-minute test. It’s not a big investment of time. What I hope is that people will take advantage of that and learn about their hearing loss sooner. For many years the people coming in to see audiologists in audiology clinics had had a serious hearing loss for 5-10 years or even longer before they did anything about it. That’s too long. And if you leave it untreated for too long your brain actually starts to deteriorate. You are not interacting with and understand your environment as much as you were when you had good hearing. You can respond to that in lots of different ways, often emotionally through depression and social isolation, and those things are not just bad for your hearing but also your health and quality of life. The real reason why you should do something about it sooner rather than later is so that you don’t have to put yourself in those awkward positions where you have to be asking people all the time “What did you say?” You should be happy to go and talk to people in noisy environments. It shouldn’t be impossible: you just need to do something about your hearing loss as soon as you notice a slight difference.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>The online test should work for people who are seven years or more. The reason is that it uses real words and children younger than seven won’t know all these words. In any case very young children require different therapies. I wouldn’t the test for people who are younger than seven, however if they already have hearing aids they can probably use this test to see for themselves how well their hearing aids are working.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>ON MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS NOT ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO BUY HEARING AIDS ONLINE</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>The medical profession routinely refer people to audiology clinics, including to Blamey Saunders hears. They don’t encourage people to buy hearing aids online - telling them that you may end up damaging your hearing and you won’t get the best result. That advice actually runs counter to my opinion that you can actually do better by looking after your own hearing rather than going to another professional and letting them do it for you. Mostly because you’re the one who knows what you are hearing. If you have always be explaining to somebody else what you are hearing so that they can adjust your hearing aid, it might take a long time to tune your hearing aids to the right point.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>The medical profession routinely refer people to audiology clinics and those sorts of things. We have had some referred people to Blamey and Saunders. I’m not quite sure how to put this but I guess they don’t encourage people to buy hearing aids online. Usually medically trained people say you shouldn’t do that and that’s a really bad thing to do. You end up damaging your hearing and all that sort of thing and you won’t get the best help. Those views actually run counter to my opinion in that you can actually do better by looking after your hearing yourself than by going to another professional and letting them do it for you. Mostly because you’re the one that knows what you’re hearing. If you have to explain that to somebody else so that they can adjust your hearing aid depending on how good you are in explaining it and how good they are in understanding might take you a long time to get to the right point.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>HOW THE HEARING AID COMMERCIALS ARE MISGUIDED</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>A lot of hearing aid marketing material is orientated towards “come spend your money and this will solve your problem.” I don’t think that is the right approach. What Blamey Saunders hears would also do would visit a lot of community clubs and explain hearing loss, how a hearing aid can help and what their options are. We had a good response from doing that. It means actually going out and engaging with the community and not just advertising.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I think empowerment and self-help are crucial parts of the message. If you think about how mobile phones have taken over the world it’s not because they are particularly cheap, but because people want to use them and understand they are missing out by not using them. You also have multiple payment options: if everyone had to cough up $500-$1000 when they bought a new phone many people couldn’t afford it. So asking people to cough up several thousands of dollars when you need a new pair of hearing aids is not the right model. I would really like to see a pay-as-you-go model for hearing aids: if people could pay $100 per month for three years rather than $3000 on the knocker, I think they would be a lot happier and they could stop paying if they stopped using their hearing aids. There are lots of things we can do to encourage people to use hearing aids.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Hearing aids provide a service. It’s not just a fancy device you put behind your ear and forget about. If you’re not actually getting the improved hearing then you shouldn’t be paying for it, and to make people pay for it upfront is a bit weird. Paying the bundled fee for a hearing aid and additional service – whether the customer needs it or not - is not quite right. The price should come down if you don’t need help.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n        </Blog.TextBlock>\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\nimport { Blog } from '../../components';\n\nexport default function june_brundell() {\n    return (\n        <Blog.TextBlock>\n            <Blog.Author>Interviewed and written by Alastair Weng</Blog.Author>\n            ‍<br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Text><i>Dr June Brundell is a climate scientist turned doctor and is currently a GP registrar in Stanthorpe, Queensland – a town of 5,000 with two interns.

When the Rudd government came on in 2007 there was a change in the funding structures and a lot of environmental scientists lost their jobs. There was no job security after that. I realised that I couldn’t really build a career: there wasn’t the mentorship, and there wasn’t the ability to focus on an area and develop yourself forward which I really wanted. I found it really frustrating and unfulfilling. So I looked around to see what my options were and medicine seemed like a really good idea because I have always been interested in it despite saying many times that I never wanted to be a doctor.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>EVERYONE KEEPS TALKING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE. HOW DOES IT AFFECT OUR HEALTH?</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>Not only does it have primary and secondary effects, it’s also going to affect key social determinants of health; food security, water security, liveable areas, living space with sea level rises and climate refugees. In addition to that, heat itself affects health. During a heat wave for example, you’ll have an increased number of dehydration events, acute kidney injuries, acute coronary syndromes and CVAs. It’s not just the daytime temperatures but if you don’t get night time cooling, then your body doesn’t get a chance to reset while it sleeps, and that’s when you tend to have the greatest risk.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>SIMPLE QUESTION - HOW DO YOU FIX CLIMATE CHANGE</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I actually don’t think that this is rocket science; I think it’s quite obvious there needs to be a societal and cultural shift and that we need to transition into renewable resources. Australia is uniquely poised: we have limitless solar energy, and we also have access to wave energy which is an option given that a large amount of our population is costal, and we certainly have plenty of wind to compensate for when it’s not sunny. I figure if countries in the UK and Europe can run primarily on solar, then we should be able to too. What’s preventing this from happening is political will. We’ve got a very reactive government that doesn’t like to believe the science because it doesn’t fit the paradigm of how they think the world should work. They seem to think that science is quite debatable when it’s not really. The science behind climate change has a greater evidence base and better level of certainty than most things we do in medicine. I think the government is very much focused on a short term electoral timeframe of three-to-four years. I doubt that they have the proactive visionary ability to move forward and deal with the big issues.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>LET'S TALK ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE CLINICAL SETTING.

Most people are actually quite comfortable that this drought is a climate change driven result. We haven’t had a drought like this before; we haven’t had fires like this before. This is not a normal event. But I’m not the right person to deal with climate change deniers – they are one of the reasons I left climate science. I’m very fact driven, so I like to present people with facts. Unfortunately, facts don’t change people’s minds; stories change people’s minds, and it’s got to come from a credible source.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY THAT DOCTORS SHOULD MIND THEIR OWN BUSINESS AND TREAT PATIENTS RATHER THAN WASTE TIME ON ADVOCACY FOR CLIMATE ACTIONS.

I always found that to be quite unfair. At University, it became more apparent to me that this was also the experience of many regional families. This was one of my core drives to study medicine, as well as to get involved in advocacy efforts. I still think that it is fundamentally wrong that patients who live outside of capital cities have on top of the burden of their illnesses, a burden of travel.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>FINDING YOUR PEOPLE</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I really enjoyed medical school in general, but there were parts of it that were very isolating. For example, I did my MD2 year in Bendigo which is my hometown, but then for MD3 I returned to the city. There wasn’t much acknowledgement or discussion about how difficult a transition it can be for somebody to change clinical schools halfway through their degree, or to integrate into a different hospital network where they might not know anyone.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I ended up getting involved with the Outlook Rural Health Club, which provided a lot of support to me in some of those difficult times, and then later I became involved in AMSA and co-founded AMSA Rural Health. Through pursuing my interests in rural health I was able to find people who shared my interests. What I love most about medicine is the people that I've been able to connect with: people who have the same desire to do better for our rural patients and communities.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>CO-FOUNDING THE AMSA RURAL HEALTH CLUB</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>It's important to acknowledge that I co-founded it with Dr Sophie Alpen, who is currently working in the Northern Territory. We were just two people who independently believed that there needed to be more focus on rural health within the medical student agenda, and more opportunity for rural students to contribute to that dialogue. At the time, AMSA was having a lot of conversations about rural health that didn't necessarily involve the voices of rural background students or rural clinical school students.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>A second reason for forming AMSA Rural Health was that while there were other rural health student groups - many of which Sophie and myself had personally been involved with - those groups often received government funding and were therefore often, formally or informally, aligned with current government policy. We both felt that there were many government initiatives in rural health that could have been done differently or better, and that there needed to be a channel where students could freely express their opinions on behalf of themselves and their communities.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO GOOD FOR PEOPLE – A CAREER IN PSYCHIATRY</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I never planned it. I realised towards the end of medical school that one of the rotations I enjoyed most had been psychiatry. I didn’t ever feel like I had to drag myself out of bed to come in, and I didn’t ever feel like leaving early. In fact, I often stayed late on the rotation. I didn’t realise it at the time, but that was a sign that psychiatry really clicked for me.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>What I enjoy most about psychiatry is the opportunity to help transform our patient’s lives for the better. We're frequently working with some of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged people in our society. Our patients are highly stigmatised by society and also within the medical profession. Their access to healthcare is often poor, and certainly in my opinion unacceptable. The potential to advocate for those patients and to help them navigate the health system for better clinical, psychological and social outcomes is huge.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Over the past six months I've been working with Victorian Aboriginal communities and out of all the work I’ve done so far in psychiatry, I’ve enjoyed this the most. I have come to really appreciate is the beauty, the strength and the resilience of Aboriginal culture, and the role of culture in the recovery journey.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>MED-ED</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I really enjoy teaching medical students. It's something I started doing formally about 6 months ago. Medical students are so enthusiastic and I think that's one thing that we can sometimes lose as doctors - that unbridled enthusiasm for just being here. Being around students reminds me of how privileged I actually am to be doing this job and how important our work is as clinicians.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>#DESTINATIONRURAL</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>Over the past few years there has been a really important and necessary focus on rural generalist training, particularly as the National Rural Generalist Pathway begins to take shape. It's my view though, that we need to reform non-GP specialist training in rural areas as well. For example, I'm extremely passionate about rural health but currently training in the city and there are a lot of other specialty registrars who find themselves in similar positions.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Myself and colleague Dr Louise Manning, who is a GP and Obstetrics registrar working in Bendigo, actually ran a national survey looking at this issue and we were overwhelmed by feedback from junior doctors interested in rural health. We were able to demonstrate that, despite substantial opportunity to participate in rural health as a medical student, the majority of junior doctors don’t receive any information about rural health careers once they graduate.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Through the Rural Doctors Association of Australia we have been able to build on this work, and recently received federal funding to start a grassroots campaign, called #destinationrural. It is slowly building momentum and we hope that #destinationrural will promote rural health opportunities, but then also act as a networking platform to connect junior doctors who have an interest in rural health.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>MAINTAINING BALANCE WHILST BEING A YES PERSON</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I think it can be really hard if you're a yes person – I myself am quite a yes person. Part of that probably stems from the fact that I'm so motivated to do good for people with the opportunities that I have. But of course you can't do good for anyone if you're unwell yourself or if you're not taking care of yourself.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Another part of it is accepting that there will always be more opportunities. I think that sometimes, part of the reason why we take on too much is because we're afraid that if we don't do it now, then we'll never get the opportunity to do it again. It’s hard to change that mindset but we have to realise that our skills and our potential will never go away.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Subtitle>GIVE UP YOUR SEAT AT THE TABLE</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>The other thing that is important is making sure that every time we get a seat at the table, we ensure that the next seat at that table is for someone who was underrepresented before we got there. Sometimes, we also have to step back and allow other people to take our seats. For example, women, LGBTQI+, Indigenous people - whichever group of people is not well represented. Sometimes the best thing that we can do for our patients is to actually step aside and allow someone to sit in our place.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Text>Photo Credit: Salty Dingo Media.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n        </Blog.TextBlock>\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\nimport { Blog } from '../../components';\n\nexport default function bradley_frew() {\n    return (\n        <Blog.TextBlock>\n            <Blog.Author>Interviewed and written by Jessie Zhou</Blog.Author>\n            ‍<br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><i>‍Dr Bradley Frew is an Academic General Practitioner based in the Peninsula Area in Melbourne, Victoria who is also a lecturer within the Department of General Practice, Monash University.

Everyone thinks that the share market is immensely complicated, difficult and risky. But it's not. There's a reason why superannuation funds invest primarly in the ASX 200, which comprises the top 200 companies in Australia - because it is safe. Even if you go with a relatively conservative super portfolio, you will still find that a large chunk of that money will be invested in blue chip Australian shares.

I think doctors are a powerful force if we want to be. The problem is that we're a hard group to coordinate. Even on issues like climate change where we have an unanimous position (both AMA and RACGP have come out with statements) and special interest groups such as Doctors for the Environment, we are not really prominent or influential. We are a hard group to coordinate because our focus is always on patients - that's where it should be. Patient outcomes come first , but it doesn't mean that we can't have these secondary roles.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I think campaigning for change that we’re passionate about is important for us.

They say that the golden rule is “Don't talk politics with your patients”. I do avoid politics in general, but I think when there's issues such as climate change that are affecting health, we should be advocates in that space. Definitely make your voices heard - junior doctors in particular. We're seeing that the horrendous bullying of junior doctors that has happened in the past is gradually changing, and the only people able to generate change is junior doctors speaking out. So don’t be silent.

It might not be the response you want, but at least it's flagging issues and they become aware of what challenges are faced.

For those who don’t know, you were a doctor and now you are working in law. Let’s start with the medicine. What initially drew you to medicine? Tell us about your training.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><b>Melanie Tan:</b> It’s a bit circular, but basically, I’ve always been a much more humanities-orientated person, which is why I love things like EP and all that. When I was growing up, I was always into the arts. I always thought I was going to be a lawyer, and I loved writing, and I loved that analysis. Then, at the age of 16, I suddenly had this bright idea, because I love talking to people as well, that I wanted to be a psychiatrist. Basically, that’s why I did medicine, because I wanted to be a psychiatrist, not for any other reason.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>My dad is also a paediatric surgeon. People always ask me if he influenced me, or if my parents made me do medicine. I say, no. The only influence my dad had is the fact that he loves his work so much. He used to take me on ward rounds, and everything. He’s really passionate about his work, so that rubbed off. Other than that, I just had it in my head I wanted to be a psychiatrist and that was decided. I think also, at school, they had a moot court in year 11 or year 12, and I found it really boring, and so I did medicine.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>My first year of med, which was all pure science in those days - chemistry, physics, all that stuff - I hated it. I was thinking about actually switching back to law after my first year of medicine. But I didn’t want to keep switching back and forth, and I knew it would be different once I started seeing the patients. I convinced myself to stay on, and just stayed on the treadmill and never got off basically. I've never really enjoyed it; the study. I was the slackest student ever. We used to cram for exams and I just wasn’t really that engaged. I never thought about it again until my fifth year of medicine when we were doing our paediatric rotation, and everyone was saying, \"This is the hardest rotation ever.\" So, I really buried myself in it. We were at the kid’s hospital then, and my dad had been there, and everyone knew my dad, because he’s a paediatric surgeon, and so I put a lot of pressure on myself during that term. I basically absorbed myself in medicine and just studied. During that time, I realized I don’t love medicine enough to do what I have to do, to do it justice. I’d also been thinking about what I wanted to do with it, and once I did my psychiatry rotation I thought “I don’t want to do this.” Academically, it was the most interesting subject out of everything, but I realized that I didn’t want to be a psychiatrist because it would do my head in.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Once I made that realization, I thought, “You know what, why don’t I go back and do law, once I finish?” Because I was already in my 5th year, so I thought I’ll finish it, and then go back and do law, and then that will be my specialisation, to combine the two. I had that epiphany too in my fifth year. I was at the Children’s Hospital in a room studying there when I had that epiphany. I suddenly felt a lot better. As soon as I made the decision that I wasn’t going to be a doctor, I felt this weight lifted off my shoulders. Actually, I think it took me a while to get to that decision about law because I was processing that I’ll finish this degree, but I won’t be a doctor.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>So, I finished it, did my internship at The Alfred Hospital just because I wanted something different after my clinical years at the Austin. While I was in The Alfred, that’s when I applied for a Masters in Health and Medical Law at Melbourne Uni. Then, I also applied to Cambridge to study law there. When I got into Cambridge, I dumped the Master because I actually wanted to be a lawyer. The reason I applied to Cambridge was because when I was studying medicine, when I thought I wanted to be a doctor, I had always planned to go over to the UK to work for a few years after I finish. Again, this was something different. I’ve always been a bit nomadic by nature and a bit restless. I always had a plan to go to the UK to work as a doctor when I finished. Why the UK? Because I didn’t have to do an exam in those days, I could just go over there and work, as opposed to America. When I decided I didn’t want to be a doctor, I thought I still want to go there. And I thought it’d be really cool to go to Oxford or Cambridge or something like that, and that’s how it happened there.  </Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I finished my internship in 1997, and in 1998 the term started in October at Cambridge, so I just spent the first half of that year locuming. Then I started in Cambridge in ‘98. I never knew when I set out to do law what I was going to end up doing. I knew I wanted to combine the two. I was at Cambridge for two years, and then I qualified as a solicitor in London. Then after that you do a year where you do a college of law exam, the practical qualification. Then I did two years training in law in London, and sort of at that time started doing medical negligence, and then I came back home after that. That’s how I ended up here, but there’s a lot more that’s happened since then.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><b>Erica:</b> Once you got into that process of doing law at Cambridge, did you love it?

It was crazy, because I also put a lot of pressure on myself too, because I was doing something that I really wanted to do, but I really loved it. I loved the study. I loved thinking about it. I remember I’d be sitting around with all my law friends, and we’d be talking about law, talking about cases. I would be so excited, so engaged. I loved talking about it. Whereas when I was in med school, and we’d sit around the dinner table with my med friends, talking about med, I used to walk off because I would be so bored. It was such a difference because I had those two things to compare with.  </Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>When we were talking about law, I just felt really into it. I remember reading judgments. The judgments in England are just beautifully written compared to the ones in Australia. I can't put my finger on it, but they are. Anyway, I used to read these judgments and get towards the end of the judgment, and literally go “Yes!” That’s how excited I was about it. I loved it. Some subjects more than others, but I did.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I loved writing, but it was a challenge at first. In my first year in law school when I had to write something, I thought, “Jeez, it is really hard to even write a sentence after six years [of medical school].” It was interesting getting back into that. I’ve always loved writing.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><b>Erica:</b> That was actually going to be one of my next questions.

I just haven’t had time to be honest.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>But I’ve always just loved it. When I was little, at school, I used to love writing stories. One of my ambitions was always to write a book. I did start doing a PhD, but I did not finish that for lots of reasons. When I was younger, I was more creative. I love being able to express myself. I love being able to deliver a message clearly. I write as a lawyer all the time. I enjoy the analysis that’s involved with it and then creating an answer.  That’s the thing with law compared to medicine as well, for me, was I found medicine was very algorithmic. It was flowchart thinking. I missed being creative because of this arty part of me that’s always been there. With law, it’s actually very creative in a way. There is an outlet for that because of the analysis, because it’s never black and white, because there’s always different arguments to look at. I enjoy being able to adapt what you write according to the audience, or according to the purpose.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I just find it fun. I think there’s some satisfaction in creating written piece from scratch. You probably as a writer yourself know where you must start with a draft and you keep working. For ages you don’t like it. Then it just comes to a point where you feel you’ve got there. It’s a really satisfying feeling when you’re proofreading your own work. The first few times takes ages because of this and that. Then you know when you get to the end of it by how it feels. The whole process of writing I find very satisfying.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><b>Erica:</b> In terms of your creativity, obviously, you said you have a creative streak.

I don’t love performing anymore. It was a weird thing because I’ve become quite introverted as I’ve got older, but there’s these things that I still love. I remember my very first memory is my dad, he used to put on these hospital pantomimes and musicals and things like that. My dad is very musical, he plays piano, drums, sings. He used to get my brother and I up on stage who sing and stuff like that. He used to get me to sing with him on the piano. We were always listening to music, jazz especially, which is what I grew up listening to. I grew up around it. I just love it.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Then, I think when I was in grade three or four, I remember just writing a musical. I wrote the script for a musical. I got two other friends together and I just wrote the script and the songs for it. I was the main part; I think I was called Amelia. Just for fun, I told my teacher about it, and the teacher got the whole class to watch our little musical with three of us singing and acting.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I was also learning ballet and things like that. At school, I was always heavily involved in drama and things like that. Like every other Asian kid, I did piano, but we were moving around so much, it was always so stop-start. I did up to grade two maybe and I hated my teacher, so I stopped. I learned the cello for a little while because I wanted to learn to play this song called ‘The Swan’. I learned to play the song and then I quit, traded my cello in for a drum kit and played that for a bit. I love the drums, but I didn’t have the time to play it at the time because I was doing my internship. I never really stuck to an instrument, to my regret. I’ve also always liked singing, but never really got into it seriously.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Basically, when I came back to Melbourne (the second time), I told myself I was going to learn to sing jazz. We’ve got an old friend, Noel Mendoza, who we’ve known for 30 years or so, he’s an amazing jazz pianist. All his kids are really talented musicians, and singers. I told myself when I came back to Melbourne from London that I’ll have lessons with Noel, and that’s what happened. I started lessons with Noel and then I just loved that. Then, it got to a stage where I felt like I needed to do a little bit more to push myself because with singing it is very different doing it in your own home or in the lesson than performing. I just gradually started singing in public. At the start I used to completely panic every time I had to sing in public. I did it to get over that panic. The reason I do it is really more for learning and self-development rather than performing I suppose. It’s all part of the learning. That’s why I do it. I love it. At the same time, it still scares me. That’s why I try and learn on the job. Gigs are a lot harder these days to get than in the old days. You don’t get those residencies like you used to anymore.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><b>Erica:</b> To take a bit of a turn, obviously I met you as a tutor at St Vincent’s. Your interest in education, was that relatively recent one, or have you been doing that for a while?</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><b>Melanie Tan:</b> I’ve been doing that for a while as well. When I finished qualifying as a lawyer in England, I came back home to Australia. As I said, I never knew how I wanted to combine the two (law and medicine). I just knew I wanted to. I didn’t know whether I wanted to be a lawyer in private practice, or in government, or in academia. Basically, I tried everything. When I came back from the UK, the first time, I wasn’t qualified in Australia yet. I needed to take a step back. I had this clean slate with these two qualifications and I wanted to take some time to decide what I actually wanted to do with them. I also freaked out about potentially losing seven years of my education and training, so I went back to medicine so I wouldn’t lose it. I did some locum work while I decided what to do.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>One of the things I did during that time, amongst other things, was teaching through people I met. I designed and taught a course in Health Law at Flinders Uni because my parents were living in Adelaide at that time. Then at the same time, I was also teaching ethics at a Monash Uni tutorial. Then I also met a lady at Deakin, who later became my PhD supervisor, who is an academic lawyer, and she was running a health and biotechnology law course to final year law students at Deakin. She taught the health law component. The person who was supposed to teach the biotechnology law component wasn’t able to do it, so she needed someone at the last minute to come in and write and teach that course. That’s what I did. I did those three things all around the same time, as well as other things at the same time. That’s when I first started doing that. I enjoyed it. I love teaching.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I realized then, and this was confirmed by the PhD experience more recently, that I didn’t want to be a full time academic, it would have also done my head in. I enjoyed doing a bit of it. I didn’t do the PhD because I wanted to be a full time academic. It was because I had stuff I wanted to write about. I just wanted to write basically.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><b>Erica:</b> One thing that I’ve always wondered about, particularly with you, as you wear a lot of hats and you have a lot of interests and you do a lot of things and you seem quite busy. I guess my question is where the concept of balance fits into all that? How do you manage to keep multiple interests going at quite a high level at the same time without hopefully burning out?</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><b>Melanie Tan:</b> It took burning out to learn how to do it. I probably burnt out two or three times in my life, but I’m always very conscious of it. The most recent one I suppose was around the time that I gave up my general registration as a doctor and went non-practicing, which was at the end of June 2018. The first six months of that year, I was locuming in ED, I was trying to do this PhD, I was working in a commercial law firm, and also helping them to build a practice in health law in the commercial space, I was teaching then too, and I started trying to do the music. Basically, I remember for those six months, I knew I was trying to do too much, and I was constantly stressed. Towards the end of that six months. That’s when I thought, “I just need to stop.”</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I always knew I was going to give up medicine at some stage, but I just was never ready to let it go. I reached a point then where I was ready to let it go. It was time to draw a line under it. I woke up one day thinking, “Okay, I’m going to not renew my contract after June.” I converted my registration to non-practicing registration, to resist the temptation of just picking up a shift again. It was a deliberate, and it was a really hard decision. It was really scary because medicine has always been there for me and it’s always been my safety net. I could just walk away from any job I wanted anytime because I knew I always had medicine. I could go back to locuming and giving that up was really scary. But I knew I had to do it, because I know it wasn’t good for me anymore. I didn’t feel I was good for patients anymore.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>After I made that decision to give up medicine, not long after that I thought, “I have to quit this law job as well.\" It also didn’t feel right for me. So, I quit that as well. I decided to take six months off sabbatical just to sit down and write the PhD to focus on that and get it out of the way so that I could move on with the rest of my life. I just took those six months off to focus on the PhD, do a bit of music and keep the teaching. That was the plan, but then my dad got sick during those six months, so none of that really happened. I just focused on family and have been since then, which is fine. I think it’s really about sometimes being very self-aware of how you’re feeling inside and allowing yourself to admit to the fact that you’re doing too much. I think I spoke about that in EP as well, it has always been self-reflecting and being conscious of what’s going on in yourself, and actually acting upon it and not ignoring it. I think that’s really important. Because if I kept going as I was, I would have definitely burnt out.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I had to sit back and really realize what my priorities were. Again, part of the reason I quit medicine was because the more I tried to hang on to that, the more time I was taking away from what I was actually good at, which was law. The doctor thing was something I was hanging on to. The more I did that, the less good a lawyer I was. I wanted to stop being a jack of all trades and try to actually master something. It’s about recognizing what’s important to you and what your priorities are. Again, when my dad got sick, my priorities changed again. The PhD went way down the bottom of the list. I didn’t care about it at all. For me, family’s always been the most important thing, but sometimes obviously things shift, depending on what’s happening.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Then there’s other things like music. Yes, that keeps me busy, but it’s also what feeds my soul. It’s what helps me. There was another period, back in 2016, where I had a really, really stressful year as well. I was doing a bit of music then, and I felt that music saved me during that time. It still does. I still stand by that. I think now, for me, music really helps me. I recognize that it’s an important thing to keep up. Even though it’s not as important in terms of income or whatever. I’m never going to go anywhere with it, but it feeds my soul.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>There was another epiphany that I had a few years ago when I left medical negligence. As soon as it came to my head, I thought, “That’s so true. That explains everything. That explains exactly why I’ve lived my life as I have. Why I am who I am and what I do.” The epiphany was (this sounds really corny): I have the heart of a doctor, the brain of a lawyer and the soul of an artist. Because I love the day to day of medicine. I loved being with patients, helping people, that interaction and leaving the ED feeling as if I at least tried to help someone, whereas you don’t necessarily need that in other jobs. Anyway, so that’s what popped into my head and I thought that does make sense, because that’s how I feel. The heart part is why I love the medicine, why I couldn’t let it go. The brain part is why I love the law. The soul part is why I love the music. When I told my family, they said, “That’s right. That’s you.”</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><b>Erica:</b> I think you just gave me the title for your piece. That’s perfect. I love it. Before you discussed how it was a really hard decision to finally leave medicine. What would you say to people who are maybe studying medicine, or are in medicine, who are having those thoughts of maybe this is not my life purpose, or I want to get out but I’m scared of leaving this thing that I’ve worked so hard to get to? What advice would you give to them? Is there a point at which you have to wait until you’re actually ready to finally make that decision?</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><b>Melanie Tan:</b> I think you do have to be ready. Personally, I think that if I had left it any sooner, I probably would have regretted it. Look, I think that is to say I would miss it from time to time. I got to the point where I knew that I wasn’t going to miss it anymore. Having said that, I think with what’s been happening with this COVID stuff, this is actually the first time since that I wish I hadn’t. I feel like I want to be able to do more. I’m looking out to see what’s happening in that space now, and if I can actually convert my non-practicing back to practicing. Then I might do that, depending on what else is happening. Obviously, this is a very unusual circumstance.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I spoke to another doctor who did the same thing as me and left clinical medicine quite early. He also used to locum in ED. He used to say, you just get little cravings for it every now and then. It’s just weird because, especially for us where our courses are a lot longer, the whole process was seven years, and we started a lot younger. It was really a big part of our growing up and part of our formative years. Plus, I grew up around it as a kid. I think, for that reason, it was especially hard to let go, because it was such a huge part of my life for so long.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I think the main thing that I always say is, and as cliché as it sounds is it is really important to be true to yourself and honest with yourself, because if you’re not going to be honest with yourself, no one’s going to be. You’re the only one who can take action on that. I think that as a doctor, the skills that we learn as medical students and as doctors are so transferable across the board. Nothing has gone wrong. The experiences and the perspectives as well are so important and so unique that none of it will have gone to waste. Don’t ever think that. I think that I got into Cambridge law just because I had a medical degree. I think as a doctor, you’re highly employable to be anything you want to be. It’s just you got to decide what that is. I’ve always believed that if you want something badly enough, and you work hard enough, you will get there. It’s all about the want. If you don’t want it bad enough, you’re not going to try hard enough and you’re not going to get there.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I wouldn’t be afraid of leaving medicine because if you can tolerate it enough, to keep it up a little bit, it helps in terms of job security. You don’t ever have to worry about not having a job. If you get to the end of the degree, and if you really, really hate it, don’t go ahead. Don’t worry about doing an internship. But if you think it’s okay, but I don’t love it, then I will probably suggest doing your internship. Because then you have the ability to locum, as a backup, so you don’t have that financial pressure. Also, talk to people if you’re thinking about leaving medicine. Don’t feel like you’re on your own because you’re definitely not.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I just think it’s all about being honest to yourself. Not only what you like, but also what you’re capable of. This is why I always go on about self-reflection and having that insight into yourself. I think that’s really important. I don’t think anyone should be afraid of trying anything, giving anything a go. If you don’t try, you’ll never know. At the end of the day it is about doing your best. Not about doing other people’s best but doing what you feel like is best for you and what makes you happy.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><b>Erica:</b> Thank you. I think that’s quite a nice place to finish on. Is there anything you’d like to add?</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><b>Melanie Tan:</b> The only thing I’d add is just to clarify what I actually do now: that I’m a health and aged care lawyer. Medicolegal tends to refer to what MDOs do, and there’s a little bit of that. In the health world basically, you have claims and complaints. There are medical negligence claims, and then you have other complaints or investigations that aren’t claims, like AHPRA or what not. But there is also regulatory work in the health space, so in health and aged care it’s about compliance, and I suppose a lot of it is about decision making, lawful decision making. It’s a different kind of area, it's more administrative government law.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><b>Erica:</b> Thank you, Mel.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n        </Blog.TextBlock>\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\nimport { Blog } from '../../components';\n\nexport default function brian_spain() {\n    return (\n        <Blog.TextBlock>\n            <Blog.Author>Interviewed and written by Jefferson Tang</Blog.Author>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            ‍<Blog.Text><i>Dr Brian Spain is the Director of Anaesthesia and Co-Director of Surgery and Critical Care at the Royal Darwin Hospital.

He was awarded Member of the Order of Australia (OAM) in 2016 for significant service to medicine in the discipline of anaesthesia, as a clinician, to healthcare standards, and to professional medical bodies.</i></Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Author>BALI BOMBINGS – “IT WAS HORRIFIC. THERE WERE PEOPLE STACKED LITERALLY THREE HIGH AND FIVE DEEP.”</Blog.Author>\n            <Blog.Text>In 2002 on the weekend that the Bali Bombings occurred, I was in Darwin co-running the first ever Anaesthesia Continuing Medical Education meeting. It was only on the Sunday morning tea break that the news got out that the Bali Bombing had happened and there was a plan to repatriate injured Australians to Darwin. So we finished off the meeting and rushed off to make preparations for receiving the victims at the Royal Darwin Hospital.</Blog.Text>  \n            <Blog.Text>I was asked to coordinate the reception of the victims at Darwin Airport. We had every ambulance in the Northern Territory – 10 in total - waiting there at that time. The first victims arrived on a Hercules plane late at night, 26 hours after the bombings happened. It was horrific going into the back of the aircraft. There were people stacked literally three high and five deep. Seeing the horrific injuries, I just snapped into medical doctor mode and organized staff to take them into the ambulances and send them to the hospital where they were ferried through the emergency department. Four Hercules airplanes arrived over a 24-hour period and a total of 65 people came through Darwin Hospital.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>It was an incredible national medical response. Every state in Australia responded and within 48 hours of the whole thing starting it had finished. Every medical retrieval jet in Australia in 2002 made its way to Darwin and evacuated injured people back to hospitals in their own respective states.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Author>“TO BE HONEST, DISASTER MEDICINE IS MOSTLY NOT THAT COMPLICATED, UNLESS YOU’RE ACTUALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF A DISASTER WHEN IT HAPPENS.”</Blog.Author>\n            <Blog.Text>By the time international teams get there, which will be three or four days if they are quick, most of the victims will either have had their surgery or will not have survived. Most of the work at this stage is wound care, some fracture work and there may be some complex plastic reconstruction work. In Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, there was a lot of wound care to do on people with infected diabetic foot wounds. It wasn’t complicated medically but it was complicated logistically.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>The living conditions were arduous: we were crowded into tents, and it was hot and humid and frequently pouring with rain. There was lots of testing of interpersonal relationships going on in such close and uncomfortable quarters. So when we select and train people, we are looking for people who are flexible and easy going.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>When I come back to Darwin the medicine is more complex and varied but we obviously have more resources. At my home hospital most people are hardworking but some are not as flexible as others. Most people working in field disasters have chosen to be there and find it really invigorating work.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>We’re also careful that we don’t take any trainees there. The feeling is that it’s not a training exercise, you’re there to deliver healthcare to the best of your ability. Some medical students and trainees get frustrated that they can’t get involved. You’ll be surprised at how quickly the years go by and then you’ll be delivering healthcare in a disaster zone with fully trained medical staff.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Author>THE GREAT THING ABOUT WORKING IN THE NORTHERN TERRITORY IS THAT THE MEDICINE IS JUST INCREDIBLY INTERESTING AND REALLY REWARDING</Blog.Author>\n            <Blog.Text>When you work in rural locations you’ve got to deal with whatever comes through the door. You don’t have another hospital that you can just transfer people immediately to. You might transfer someone a few hours later after being stabilized. In Darwin we’re 3,000 kilometers away from the next referral hospital so we tend to deal even more with whatever comes through the door. It’s medically challenging but it keeps up a very broad range of skills.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>We have a large Aboriginal population – just under 30% of the population in the Northern Territory is Aboriginal. But in the acute hospital setting probably 50% of our patients are Aboriginal. Many of them live a very traditional life. You get exposed to amazing aspects of traditional Aboriginal culture that I just had no idea about when I lived in other parts of Australia. Most people who get an opportunity to do an elective here or work as a junior doctor find it incredibly interesting and really rewarding medicine, albeit hard work. It’s a great opportunity that you don’t really hear about when you’re living in the big cities.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Author>FROM WANTING TO BE A RURAL GP -> ANAESTHETICS AND HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT</Blog.Author>\n            <Blog.Text>When I finished medical school in Melbourne I thought I wanted to be a rural GP. Working in my resident years at Box Hill Hospital I loved emergency work so I then started on the path as an emergency medicine trainee. As part of that I had a one-year anaesthesia rotation to a hospital in a town called Taunton in the UK. I had no idea what anaesthesia was about before that, but I soon realized how amazing it was. I stayed on in the UK for another six months to do an obstetric rotation because I was still thinking about becoming a rural GP, however by the end of that rotation I realized that I really wanted to pursue anaesthesia as a career.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I came back to Australia but didn’t really want to come back to Melbourne. I wanted to see and experience a different place so I got onto the anaesthetic training program in Perth where I did the first couple of years. My wife then finished her GP training and got a job in East Arnhem Land up in the Northern Territory. I took a year off the anaesthesia training program and we went and lived up there. We were up there for six months and then we went traveling for the next six months. After that I came back and finished anaesthesia training in Melbourne where my family was.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>By that time I realized that I wanted to work in a more remote place so I got a job in Darwin. I thought I was going to be up here for a year or two. That was back in 1997. It’s 2019 and I’m still here. That tells you what an awesome place it is to work.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I have loved every day that I have worked in anaesthesia. People think you just put people to sleep and you don’t have much to do with people; you actually have a lot to do with people when you’re dealing with complex medicine. You’re working with the theatre team, and you also have many encounters with extremely anxious patients. Part of doing the job well is to allay their anxieties and explain what’s going to happen to them.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>We’re also getting increasingly involved in perioperative medicine: not just what happens in the operating theatre, but also optimizing their preoperative condition and caring for them postoperative. Anaesthesia involves pharmacology and physiology in action, mixed in with a lot of really interesting encounters with patients. I’ve also picked up intensive care skills and anaesthesia has given me the skills to work in the disaster setting.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I have also gotten involved in healthcare management in my middle 30s. What I have learned is that if you become a manager of a good team, you can actually do more good for more people by looking after my team and ensuring my department has happy doctors.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I love going to work every day and not quite knowing what is going to be coming around the corner.</Blog.Text>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Blog.Author>NO MATTER WHAT, KEEP YOUR PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES AT THE CENTRE OF EVERYTHING YOU DO</Blog.Author>\n            <Blog.Text>As a Director of Medical Services I talk to junior doctors frequently. It’s very easy to get a little disillusioned sometimes in the training system in public hospitals. I always tell junior doctors to just keep the patients and their families at the centre of whatever you do; Focus on looking after them and that will allow you to put up with all the other things that happen in the health system that you find frustrating.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Particularly up here in the Northern Territory where you see so many disadvantaged Aboriginal people that have been subject to multigenerational oppression, racism and all sorts of terrible things.

He told me a very personal story about how his grandmother had dementia, and how he went back to her hometown in Italy, did a tour of her house and the neighborhood with a basic GoPro 360, switched the recording into a 3D format and popped a VR headset onto her head. His grandma was able to spark precious memories such as old Italian dances.Her mood lifted and she became much more sociable. These were powerful effects that he had been able to evoke through VR, which hadn’t been triggered from 2D video or photos.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>This really got me thinking about how we can use virtual reality, particularly at a time where VR is much more accessible and affordable through advanced mobile phone technology. We found some interesting evidence in the burns literature suggesting that using virtual reality during burns could decrease pain, even to the extent of potentially reducing opioid medication doses. The Gate Control theory of Pain suggests that if you immerse a patient into a virtual environment and engage all their senses, it would powerfully reduce their ability to register pain. This got me thinking – how can we apply this to everyday medicine now that VR is becoming a lot easier to use?</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>My co-founder Paul, is an adult respiratory physician. He was asking me “What do you do to all your patients? They come to me as they’re transitioning into adulthood (especially patients with cystic fibrosis) and some of them are so needle phobic that I have to book in general anesthetic to change their IV drip every three days.” We put two and two together, and figured – why don’t we improve these basic medical procedures that we take for granted and we think are really simple, but our patients are really scared of them. We know that early traumatic experiences can establish needle phobia and healthcare avoidance for life.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Working in pediatrics I have poked a lot of kids. I felt guilty when I missed, and for pediatric residents it’s one of the biggest causes of stress in their work – guilt around hurting patients while doing necessary tests. On the otherhand, we see some doctors do a fantastic job managing patients and I wondered about how we could scale their approach so that every patient has the same opportunity to receive high-quality care for procedural pain management.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>That’s how we started using virtual reality and testing it to improve our own medical practice.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Author>PURSUING PEDIATRICS</Blog.Author>\n            <Blog.Text>I think the first thousand days of life is really the most important time in your life.

I felt that if you could make a positive difference early on and get the child onto a positive health trajectory, that could impact the child and also the family and community significantly.</Blog.Text>\n            ‍<br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Author>THE HUMAN RESOURCES CHALLENGE IN START-UPS</Blog.Author>\n            <Blog.Text>I think a lot of the challenges in driving a startup can be anticipated. We knew it was going to be difficult to bring an idea into reality and then into a commercial arena. The good thing about medicine is that you develop that skillset of assessing a situation comprehensively, and then making a diagnosis and planning how to manage all the things that could go wrong.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>The biggest challenge I deal with on a day-to-day basis is the human resources element: finding the right team that is really great at their job, but also comfortable with ambiguity and risk and a constantly evolving job description. Often it comes from a mindset of wanting to learn and grow and expand, and becoming comfortable with being outside your comfort zone. It’s key to have the right judgement to know: when can I do something safely? When should I get an expert in to help?</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Author>GROWING INTO A GENTLE AND QUIET, YET EFFECTIVE LEADER</Blog.Author>\n            <Blog.Text>One of my teachers from high school – Rosemary Barkley – was incredibly passionate as a history teacher. She really brought Revolutions (a senior secondary history subject) to life. She also led the social service program, which I was really involved in. I definitely wasn’t the smartest student or the best students, and I didn’t have a lot of confidence in myself. She was one of the first people who really believed in me and backed me as a person. She taught me that you could be a gentle and quiet leader, yet still very effective.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Dr Cathy Crock, a paediatric haematologist and Founder of The Hush Foundation, is also such an inspiration to me.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I think quiet leaders often reflect a lot and improve quickly to external feedback as well as their own – they are their own harshest critics. I think through listening, you can really understand what people are thinking and what their needs are, and therefore how to improve a team or culture. That is ultimately what leadership boils down to: Being able to get everyone aligned and believing in the same cause, and wanting to do their best to contribute to it.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Often it comes down to putting yourself out there and being outside your comfort zone, even when it’s not easy. I think over time people put their trust in you and you grow into that role. I’ve seen lots of people make amazing progress.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Author>BE KIND TO YOURSELF AND TO OTHERS</Blog.Author>\n            <Blog.Text>Be kind to yourself.

Thank you for joining us. Let’s start with your medical career. What made you want to become a doctor in the first place and how did that take place and where did you study?</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><b>Dr. Katie Allen:</b> Well, I grew up in a very medical family. My father was a doctor. My grandfather was a doctor. My great aunt was a doctor. My great uncle was a doctor. My mother, also my father and grandfather, both married nurses, so I grew up in a very medical family. When I was seven, I used to go on ward rounds up in Albury with my father and I loved it. My father loved his work. He just really cared deeply for his patients. He was very well respected, and he loved the study of medicine. I was embedded in a family that was about service to community through health.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Then, I went through a stage when I was about 14, thinking maybe I was doing it because of family pressures, even though no one ever told me I should do medicine. I started thinking about being a lawyer or a journalist and all these other things. When I got to the end of school, I decided that in medicine you could actually do all of those things. You could be a medical journalist or you could be a medical lawyer or you could do research. I realized there’s so much choice within medicine, why not do medicine and then branch out afterwards? That’s why I decided to do that, which at that time was quite unusual. I think most people thought I wanted to do medicine to be a doctor. I had always thought about what else I could do as well. It was only later in life I realized that as soon as I finished medicine, I started doing medical research because I was trying to fix the healthcare system.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I studied medicine at Monash University. I had always wanted to travel overseas, but my father wouldn’t let me. He kept saying, ‘Don’t break your school studies to go on a Rotary exchange scholarship,’ even though I won one, ‘because you want to get a good mark to get into medicine.’ Then I finished school, and he said, ‘Don’t take a gap year. You’ve got into medicine, get going with that.’ Finally, by the time I got to fourth year [of medicine], I was being a bit more canny about how I would try and encourage my dad to support me to go overseas. I looked around for an overseas exchange in research. At the time I was the President of the Monash University Medical Students’ Association, so I would sit on the medical faculty board. I remember asking people, ‘Do you know anywhere else where I could do a research year overseas?’ After about six months of asking, someone said, ‘Well, you could go and do an exchange year at Cambridge University. Would that be okay?’ I ended up brokering an exchange year at Cambridge at a time, when that never used to happen. It’s quite normal now, but it was a really great opportunity to spend some time overseas. I think that’s where I really got into research.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I finished medicine and then started to specialize in paediatrics. Then I got into research as part of my Advanced Training and I’ve always done clinical work and research. I’ve never really done clinical work full time. I did research because I’ve been interested in not just responding to patients coming through the door, but trying to stop them coming in in the first place. That is what has driven me in my medical research career. I did three large research projects which were trying to enact change. One was on population genetic screening for haemochromatosis, and the genetics revolution wasn’t ready to do that, but I think we’re pretty close to it now. I made a 10-year contribution to that area, which was pretty satisfying, including ensuring that life insurance discrimination doesn’t happen here or around the world. I did some pretty innovative research to help in that area.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I also worked for my PhD in liver cell transplant. I was specializing in hepatology, and because liver transplants were complex and risky operations, we were trying to work out a simpler way to do that. I undertook Australia’s first liver cell transplant, which was very exciting. It worked for a while, but then it failed. Then I basically did some more research to work out why it failed. We found that there was a different form of rejection that we hadn’t thought was a problem. We were the first to describe that in the world. Unfortunately, we shut the whole field down internationally, which was quite devastating having spent 10 years of my life working on that.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Then I switched to food allergy because I was finding a whole lot of patients coming through my door, and it seemed to be this rising epidemic. I launched what I would say is probably quite a successful collaborative research agenda across the whole of Australia. We’ve already started to turn the tide back with the food allergy epidemic so that was very satisfying. I had a very satisfying clinical research career. I was regarded as a leader in the field. I had a large research portfolio myself. I had 30 people that I supervised every year to bring in grants for them, and was also a Theme Director. I was a manager for a research division of 400 people, and I sat on the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute executive. I was a professor at the University of Melbourne, a professor at the University of Manchester. I loved what I was doing, but felt that I was interested in what more I could do. Even though it was extremely satisfying, I still wanted to do more.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Politics, I have to say, is the best decision I’ve ever made. It was scary because I was jumping into the deep end. I was really putting my whole career at risk, but I got lucky, I suppose.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><b>Erica:</b> Sounds incredible. You actually answered one of my questions, which was about your research and how that came about. You covered that pretty thoroughly. Before we move onto the politics, what was it about paediatrics in particular that interested you, if you can remember if you had a really strong reason?</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><b>Dr. Katie Allen:</b> It is interesting because during my training at the Royal Melbourne, in the first six months of my internship, one of the cardiology directors said, ‘Would you like to do cardiology? You’re really very talented at this.’ And I said, ‘No, I want to do paediatrics.’ He said, ‘Why do we lose all women to pediatrics? You should stay in adult medicine.’ I said back to him, ‘Because there’s so much more hope in paediatrics.’</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Even when children are going through serious conditions, and some unfortunately do die, even when they’re dying of cancer, they’re still growing and developing. More importantly than that, the impact you have on one life can be profound for the rest of their life, but also on the family. The ability to influence a life trajectory, but also the life trajectories of those around that person and support them is quite immense.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><b>Erica:</b> Tell us about your transition into politics. You described it as jumping off a cliff. I can imagine it was quite daunting. When and how did that happen? Had you already had a foot in the door of politics or was it completely blind leap of faith?</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><b>Dr. Katie Allen:</b> Well, as a senior researcher in Australia, you do have a lot to do with lobbying ministers and you have a lot to do with bureaucracies. As the Theme Director of Population Health, I initiated a Lunches with Government seminar series where I invited bureaucrats who would come to the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute. It’s better to partner with government because a significant amount of research funding is government contracts for institutes. I knew people in the area. I only joined the Liberal Party three and a half years ago. My mother was the secretary of the Liberal Party in Albury, where I grew up, but she died prematurely, and I never got involved. I do remember mum going off to events, but not really getting very engaged. I was busy through my 20s and 30s and even my 40s having a busy career and raising a family of four kids. The world passes you by when you’re right down the coalface.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>It was only when my kids were starting to get older that I became more politically aware and more aware of the fact that so much of what government does influences each and every one of us each and every day. I was really looking for what was my next research agenda going to be. One of them I was very interested in as a gastroenterologist, so someone who is interested in nutrition and food, was looking at obesity prevention. Everywhere I looked, a lot of the leaders [in that field] are really government leaders. A lot of the things I was becoming more interested in were across disciplines, and in public health. Public health is really government health. The whole concept of getting the ambulance at the top of the cliff rather than waiting for business at the bottom has always been something that’s been in my DNA. One part of that is being a paediatrician, because that’s the way we think. A lot of the big [public health] lifestyle changes have been made by paediatrics, discovering immunization or [improving] sanitation, and all those things. Paediatricians naturally think in a very preventive way.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Anyway, if you really are into prevention, then the government is the place to be. One day I was speaking to the [Victorian] Shadow Health Minister, Mary Wooldridge, and she said, ‘Are you interested in politics or policy?’ I just responded, ‘Politics.’ She said, ‘Do you want to map out what you might want to try and do? I said, ‘Let’s do it.’ I had no idea what I was putting my hand up for, but I ran at the state level in Prahran, in Victoria. I had to run for pre-selection, which was the most daunting thing I think I’ve ever done. Because when you stand up at pre-selection, you’re being asked questions that you don’t know the answers to because there’s no textbook or guide about how to answer the questions. They could ask you things about politics from 20 years ago that I would have no idea about, or insight and knowledge about the party, about who was the president previously or what your view was on the Victorian state budget. These are quite complicated questions and it was a very rapid learning process of how to handle these difficult questions.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I ran for the seat of Prahran in November 2018 where we lost the seat and the election and the next day I got interviewed by an Age journalist. He said, ‘Well, Katie, you’re in the Liberal Party. You just got wiped out. It must’ve been tough; you must’ve been bullied.’ I said, ‘There’s nothing further from the truth. I had a blast!’ They actually quoted me in the paper saying that, and the reason I wanted them to write that is because I want to have the opportunity to snowplow for others to follow. [At the time I thought] I might not get there, but we need more people who are evidence-based decision makers, who know how to deal with the public [who are] inside the tent. We need more scientists, doctors, engineers, people who are problem solvers. I actually think doctors make great politicians. I mean, as a doctor, my skill set includes dealing with the community from all walks of life. Some of them don’t agree with me. I’m helping them to get to a place of better health and outcomes that help them even if they don’t approve of the way I think about things. They still want solutions. That sounds like politics.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>As a medical researcher, I’ve had to bring teams together behind me for a common goal that I’ve decided this is how we’re going to get there. I need to bring volunteers and resources behind me to try and lead a campaign, and that’s the same as with medical research. Someone doesn’t give you a job, you actually have to have an idea and get the grants, get ethics [approval], get the project completed. Being up in Canberra is actually like being in an international conference. You’re dealing with people from all different backgrounds, from all over the country, just like when you’re at a global conference all over the world and you have differences of opinions that you need to try and find common ground. As a medical researcher, you do a lot of media, a lot of fundraising, and that’s what you do as a politician as well.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><b>Erica:</b> A lot of people have said that skill set is actually quite transferable to politics. Certainly, the people that I’ve spoken to previously, which I find quite interesting. In terms of your day to day work at the moment, obviously I imagine it might look a little bit different right now, what you normally do. What does your day to day as an MP look like?</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><b>Dr. Katie Allen:</b> It’s funny. I asked that of Mary Wooldridge back when I was running at state level, because I was wondering what I was putting myself up for. She said every day is different, and that is exactly right. It’s a fascinating job. When I’m in Canberra, my day starts at 6:30am and finishes after 10:30pm. You start the day by reading all of the press clippings and being on top of what’s going on in the world. Then you might do a press conference because you’ve been put on the doors as a backbencher, so at the doors there’s a pack of journalists and we have to answer the questions for the day. Then parliament starts, and you sit in parliament while it opens,.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>There are divisions where the bells ring, and we have to run to the floor in order to vote. I give at least one speech a day in parliament. Sometimes I’ll give four in a day. There’s lots of different ways that you give speeches. There are constituent statements, there are 90-second statements, there are debates about bills, there are adjournment debates, there are grievance debates…there are all sorts of debates!</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Then, there’s committee meetings. I’m on seven parliamentary committees. I’m also on seven policy committees and I’m also co-chair of several Parliamentary Friends Committees such as Child and Adolescent Health, UNICEF, Preventive Health and Cancer Cures. I do a lot of committee work, which is again like academia, and fascinating. Some of the work that we do is really exciting, very interesting and makes a big difference. You meet with ministers, and you also have events where Parliamentary Friendship Groups bring an issue to parliament to try and advocate for a different outcome. There’s a lot of health things that are being advocated for, because every health group has an advocacy or support group, and that's usually tied to a Parliamentary Friendship Group.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Every day there’ll be an event. [For instance] where someone talks about cystic fibrosis, and what can we do to improve testing and screening? There might also be someone who’s trying to raise awareness about lung cancer, how to get more funding and wellness practitioners to support lung cancer. It’s amazingly similar to my work, but instead of just being in paediatrics or in my area of gastroenterology, it’s right across the health spectrum. There are also similar committees in Parliamentary Friends in trade or in economics and defense. It’s just huge. It is like a water siphon, the amount information in there. I feel like I’ve just finished university, it’s my first job and I’m learning a lot very quickly. It’s very exciting. That’s when I am in Canberra, which is 20 weeks of the year.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>The other weeks I’m in my electoral office, where I am today. Basically, I go from community event to community event; visiting communities, community groups, going to Aged Care [Facilities], childcare, hospitals, schools, presenting flags, volunteer groups, giving volunteer awards, the Higgins Medal for School Kids. We’re about to do a Climate Solutions Tech Expo, doing a Senior Citizens Expo, just heaps of things in the community. I’m always being asked to cut a ribbon, give a speech, advocate for something, and then there’s a lot of constituent work. We have what we call clinics where people book in and I spend half an hour speaking to them about their issues, whether that be visa issues, Centrelink issues, what they want the government to do better or worse, those sorts of things.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><b>Erica:</b>  With so many pulls on your time and your energy, how do you go about prioritizing the things that you can make a difference on? And then perhaps realizing that you won’t be able to help every single person that comes into your office, I imagine that’s a challenge?</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><b>Dr. Katie Allen:</b> Well, my number one priority is, every single person who comes to my office. So, the constituent work is prioritized. Like a doctor, if you don’t look after the patients, you can’t do the extra bits because that’s our core business. Every constituent gets an email or a phone call back, or a meeting and we will try to resolve the question by asking for ministerial support or by resolving it ourselves.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>The constituent work is actually deeply satisfying and extremely important. There’s a lot of it. I have staff to help me with that. The committee work is very large. There’s a lot of paperwork to read through, but again as an academic, I’m used to sifting through large amounts of paperwork, so that’s fine. In trying to advocate for the things that you’re passionate about, you’ve got to really just try and focus particularly on things like the Parliamentary Friends Groups. I like health and education, because I’ve been on the board of local hospital, a medical research and doctor, but also education because I’ve been the chair of the local school council. My strengths I think are science and technology. Anything that’s health, education, science and technology. My seat of Higgins cares a lot about the big issues, like climate action responsibility, and refugees, so getting very involved in some of the social agenda issues are quite important. I basically prioritize climate change, health education, science and technology.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><b>Erica:</b> Brilliant. It’s impossible not to ask a question about it, but how is the COVID-19 pandemic has affected your work and your role as an MP?  Editor note: this interview took place March 1st 2020, prior to the introduction of government social distancing measures.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><b>Dr. Katie Allen:</b> Well, we’re not going to Canberra, so that’s changed that bit, and I’m in the community and I’m basically more office bound. I’ve been going to maybe one community event a day, whereas before I’d go out to six a day. When I’m normally working, I’ll have two to three events in the evening. I go to none of those now, so in some ways, that’s quieter. The emails and telephone calls have increased, there’s usually three telephones running at once, and I’m getting about 1,000 emails a day. It’s just changed in the nature of the work. People are asking questions about the Prime Minister’s announcements. They’re confused and concerned, so we have to allay those fears, and give them the correct information. It’s very busy at the moment with just coronavirus because that’s the emergency we’re facing.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>But also looking long term for 6 or even 12 months when it starts to lift up, how to make sure that the economy is ready, and that people are ready for the businesses to reactivate. We’re already starting to think that far out. There’s also committee work continuing by Zoom or by teleconference. I’m on the National Redress Committee and we’ve been listening to witnesses talking about what happened to them 20, 30 years ago. We also have [other] Committee reports coming out, [ready for] signing off on. The committee work still continues. A lot of the work is reactivating, but online. Our priority is to make sure that coronavirus is being addressed first because that’s what’s concerning constituents and understandably, they want the information very rapidly so that they can make decisions for their lives.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I’ve just been down to the Prahran Town Hall where Star Health has been commissioned by the Federal Government to start the first standalone pop up clinic for rapid access coronavirus testing. I went through as the first client, and I checked all their facilities and made sure they’re all fine. Someone was down there taking some photos, and we are very proud that we’ve got the first standalone clinic outside of GPs clinic for coronavirus [here in Higgins].</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><b>Erica:</b> That’s really exciting. A slightly different tact here, but as a woman in both medicine and then in politics, have you ever faced any challenges or barriers that you felt were related to gender, and if so, how did you overcome that?</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><b>Dr. Katie Allen:</b> Well, in paediatrics we are very female predominant, so I used to be the Equal Opportunities Officer to the staff. At the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute, because 80% of employees are women, I used to joke a little bit tongue-in-cheek that I was there for the men as the minority group. Not that I was, by the way, but [my role as EOO] was more about diversity. We were a very tolerant, diverse community in paediatrics. So, I often say to people, I grew up being strong in an environment where I didn’t see any of that [sexist] stuff going on. Very occasionally, I mean, one person when I was being interviewed, because I have four kids, and she was a female without children, she actually asked me, ‘Have you stopped having kids yet?’ Now, that’s really inappropriate.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>The sorts of issues I would come up against, I would say, are very subtle, which is why I’m a big believer in shining light in dark corners. I’m not frightened of what people tell me as long as they talk to my face, because it’s very hard to deal with unconscious bias that has no light shone on it. I’m a big advocate for free speech, of course, respectfully. Sometimes when people say things out loud, it actually makes it very obvious to others that they’re bigots, and then it can become quite obvious to them as well.</Blog.Text>\n            ‍<br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><b>Erica:</b> I don’t think they were quite right either. It seems like you’ve had quite a rewarding career.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><b>Dr. Katie Allen:</b> Well, when I had two kids, they said that’s enough now. Then I had three, and they ask “haven’t you heard of contraception?” Then when I had four, well, that’s really end of your career because I always put my family first. It’s just me, because at the end of the day, [my family are] going to be holding my hand at the end. If you don’t have love, you don’t have anything.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><b>Erica:</b> That’s very, very true. Aside from your career, what other things do you like to fill your time with? As you said family is really important, but what about the interests, hobbies, passions that you do on the side?</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><b>Dr. Katie Allen:</b> Well, I’m a swimmer. I love ocean swimming. We've got a little family getaway, down at the beach and when I’m down there I will swim 2km every day in the ocean. I love walking as a family, so we walk the dog and we chat, chat, chat. Anyone who is home we go for a walk at the end of the day, it might be 10 o’clock at night but we just get out there, talk and walk. My husband and I go to the theater. I’ve been subscribing to Melbourne Theater Company since I was 18. We love camping, we’ve been all over Outback Australia. We do love traveling, so we’ve been all over the world as a family. I’ve had a sabbatical overseas, long service overseas. My husband is English, so we tend to go home to his family. I love reading, just spending time with kids.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>A lot of my discretionary time was voluntary things. I’ve been a volunteer as a pro bono member of the Cabrini Health Board and a pro bono Chairman of the school council, which were things that I was very passionate about, but it also built skill sets. The day after I got pre-selected, I went in to work and on Monday and I resigned from the Cabrini Health Board. On Tuesday, I resigned after 28 years service to the Royal Children’s Hospital. On Wednesday, I stepped down as Chair of Melbourne Girls Grammar Council and handed it over to the Deputy. On Thursday we had two US NIH professors visiting, and I told them that I was handing over the [NHMRC] Centre of Research Excellence [in Food Allergy] to some young leaders that I had been supporting and developing. On Friday I handed over $6 million in NHMRC grants to other researchers in my team. On Saturday, I went back home to my family and said, ‘You're it!’ So, that was a pretty weird week, stripping back everything I’ve been working for, and then submitting myself to the process [of running as a political candidate in a Federal Election]. It was “maybe in 10 weeks’ time I’ll be elected”, or “maybe I'll fall flat on my face and I’ll just have to start all over again”.</Blog.Text>\n            ‍<br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><b>Erica:</b> Fair enough. That sounds like a real act of faith, but it has obviously paid off.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><b>Dr. Katie Allen:</b> I’m lucky!</Blog.Text>\n            ‍<br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><b>Erica:</b> In terms of advice, our audience is mostly medical students and junior doctors, many of whom are interested in the range of possibilities within their medical career and outside of a medical career if they choose. What advice would you give to them about a career in medicine, and then also those who are interested in politics as a potential future career?</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><b>Dr. Katie Allen:</b> I’ll give you three pieces of career advice that has held me in good stead. To my father, I’d always say, ‘What should I do?’ It didn’t matter whether the question was should I do medicine, or even within medicine, what should I do? Because I always used to get so excited by different subspecialties. I wanted to do psychiatry, and then I realized I talk too much, and don’t listen as well as I should. I wanted to do surgery, but I realized that I’m pretty impatient. I would probably not be a good surgical personality. Anyway, the first piece of advice is what my father said: do what you love doing. If you love it, you’ll be good at it. If you’re good at it, you’ll always have a job. I think there’s a real element of truth to that. Nowadays the pop psychologists have some much sexier way of saying it, but follow your passions is a worthwhile thing.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>The second thing is don’t think that a pathway is clear from the outset. People rarely do follow a path of “I’m going to be X”. You want to be in a position where you have a skill set, you have a willingness and a readiness to try things, and then be open to opportunities. There were doors that I would knock on and hope to be, and I wouldn’t get a job, or I wouldn’t get a promotion, or I wouldn’t get a grant. I would knock a couple of times, because you do have to be careful to give it a good shake at the door and then realize this door was not opening for me. So, then I’d go and knock on another door. Sometimes I’d open that door and there would be Aladdin’s cave behind that door. I think being open to possibilities and opportunities is very important.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>In medical research, I learned a lot of resilience, because there’s only a 12% success rate. Making sure you’ve done a lot of thinking about what are the consequences of the opportunities is really important. With research grants, I used to say to people, I had 100% success rate, because you’ve only failed when you stopped trying. As it turned out, I ended up getting every single grant that I applied for in food allergy. Though when I’d been in a previous area, I hadn’t got any grants, so moving areas was actually obviously very helpful. When you find gold, you just keep on mining it, I suppose.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>The other piece of advice I would give is to seek advice widely. Be open to people who give advice. There’s lots of people who give you advice. You don’t have to listen to it [all], or you don’t have to follow it [all]. You should listen politely and be very gracious and grateful for any advice people give. Just because you’re listening to advice doesn’t mean you need to take it. You need to work out what’s right for you. The more advice you're taking broadly, the better quality of decision making you have because they’ll be able to see it from different perspectives. Sometimes the advice I would take would be 180 degrees opposite to what the advice was given. The fact that the advice was given gave me great clarity about why I wasn’t going to take that advice.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><b>Erica:</b> Brilliant. Thank you for that. I like the three distinct points. Thank you so much for taking time out to have a chat with me today.

There were many things I liked about school, mainly the sciences and maths. After school, I looked at jobs related to the sciences, but I wasn’t sure.

So, I entered medical school with an open mind.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />  \n            <Blog.Subtitle>Medical school</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I liked everything I did at medical school, but I was unusual in that I absolutely loved pathology. I felt it was the first time the lecturers treated us as adults. They explained how conditions developed and then questioned our understanding. For histology, they gave us a big box of slides to look at and make diagnoses. The idea that you could look down a microscope and work out what was wrong with someone really appealed to me. By the end of medical school, I knew I wanted to do pathology.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />  \n            <Blog.Subtitle>Challenges as a young doctor: <i>“Scrubs is the most realistic TV show I’ve ever watched”</i></Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>When I graduated, I was reluctant to do a residency because I was set on pathology, but I was told that if I didn’t do a residency, I wouldn’t be a registered doctor - I’d just have a degree.

You had to be well prepared for the morning ward round, anticipate what people would require of you. It’s like what you see on the show Scrubs. That’s the most realistic medical show I’ve ever watched. Sure, we experienced bullying, but it was the gentle kind. The main thing was avoiding public humiliation. If you were asked: “What’s that patient’s haemoglobin?” and replied: “I don’t know”, you’d be told, “I don’t know isn’t a value.” So, the lesson was to get organised and find ways to get things done.  </Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />  \n            <Blog.Subtitle>“<i>It’s amazing how things turn out”</i> – from choosing pathology, to being chosen for microbiology</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>In the year of my internship, my University (the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg) formed a School of Pathology by amalgamating the University Department of Pathology with a clinical pathology institute: The South African Institute for Medical Research. The aim was to address the shortage of pathologists who were prepared to teach. I asked the Director of the Institute for a training position in anatomical pathology, but there were no vacancies. Instead, he offered me one in microbiology, and I took it.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I then trained in haematology because it was a small subject compared to microbiology, and I thought it would be good to balance these two disciplines. People would ask me how I found hematology after microbiology. I’d joke and say that in microbiology there are thousands of microbes and other infectious agents, but in hematology, there are only three types cell you need to know. I mean, platelets aren’t even cells - just bits of cells.

I was planning to do a project on idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, but my boss told me he couldn’t supervise me because he’d been promoted and wouldn’t have the time. As I said, I was an only child and was used to getting my way. I was upset and felt rejected. So, I walked out of the Haematology office and went straight to the Microbiology office to see my former boss. I told him I’d decided to come back to microbiology to complete my pathology training and do a PhD project. He said, “That’s fantastic because I’ve just been awarded a grant to investigate the causes of diarrhoea in black African children.”</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>The best part about my PhD research was that I had to do “real” science, meaning that I had to try to prove myself wrong. At the time, rotavirus and enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) were newly discovered causes of diarrhoea, and my research hypothesis was that they would account for most cases of diarrhoea in my study population. However, I found that enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) was the most prevalent pathogen in these children. This was an unpopular idea at the time. In fact, there was an article in the New England Journal of Medicine that referred to “so-called” enteropathogenic E. coli.  At the time, I was one of the few researchers in the world who believed that EPEC was a pathogen. Then came enterohaemorrhagic and enteroaggregative E. coli. I was a member of the team that discovered the latter.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />  \n            <Blog.Subtitle>Practicing infectious diseases in South Africa</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>Practicing infectious diseases in South Africa in the 1970s and 1980s was amazing. In Durban hospital where I ran the diagnostic microbiology laboratory, on any one day I could find a case of tetanus, rabies, or tuberculous meningitis. When doctors visited our hospital from overseas, they’d ask to see interesting cases. So, I’d take them on a ward round to the paediatric ICU and point out a baby with neonatal tetanus – a condition my visitors thought only happened in textbooks. Even I was surprised by some cases. For example, a doctor once told me he had a patient with a typhoid breast abscess. I asked how he knew, and he said they had drawn pus out of the breast and it grew Salmonella Typhi.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I also received some very bizarre phone calls, such as when I was called about a patient who had been bitten by a lion. The treating team called me because they thought the lion may have been rabid, but they couldn’t confirm it because it had run away. I asked them why they thought it was rabid, and they said because the lion came into the village and started attacking people at random, which was not normal lion behaviour.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />  \n            <Blog.Subtitle>Take on COVID-19 (pre-declaration by WHO as a pandemic)</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>It's hard to prophesy about this, because the situation changes every day, but I think it's highly unlikely we're going to escape this in Australia.

There’s lots of health issues and poverty there. As a kid, I always wanted to do something that was meaningful, something that would change a community, or change people’s outlook on life. I believe the poverty that you see in a third world country really shapes the kind of person that you become. When we came to Australia, my Dad got unwell and was diagnosed with cancer during my HSC. I saw some really great doctors who were super helpful with Dads’ journey. I also saw some not so great clinicians. I remember when he was diagnosed, the doctor was so blunt and brief with us. I remember walking out and just feeling, I think I probably would have done a better job breaking that news. From there, it became passion, that I would end up being a doctor, and help people in a similar situation. We get used to seeing people who are unwell and it becomes a day to day norm. I think if you ground yourself and remember that this could be the worst day of somebody’s life, you won’t lose your humanity.</Blog.Text>\n            <br /> \n            <br /> \n            <Blog.Subtitle>RURAL EXPERIENCE</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I actively sought opportunities to gain rural medical experience. I just started contacting the rural doctors network and the workforce agencies to ask them if they wouldn’t mind having a medical student tag along to outreach clinics and things like that. I littered all of my medical school holidays with rural clinical things. I know that it’s really hard to get rural placements and they are getting increasingly popular. I always tell people, there are opportunities. You might have to self-fund some of the time, but it’s so worth it. I was doing clinical things before some of my colleagues had even stepped into a hospital.</Blog.Text>\n            <br /> \n            <br /> \n            <Blog.Subtitle>FINDING MOTIVATION</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I remember, as a young, naive medical student, I had this thought that I just wanted to be a doctor that was really useful. If a friend was to become unconscious at a party, which doctor would you want? Would you want the ophthalmologist or the paediatric neurologist? Would you want an emergency physician or someone with intubating skills and things like that? I was, like look, honestly, I just want to be useful. I want to be good at lots of things so that I can help a community. I think that’s what motivates me most about my job. That no matter what a patient walks in with, in the vast majority of cases, I can get them feeling better when they walk out.</Blog.Text>\n            <br /> \n            <br /> \n            <Blog.Subtitle>A RURAL GENERALIST CAREER</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I always wanted to be a non GP specialist because general practice seemed way too hard. I thought there was no way I was going to be good at everything the way that GPs are. However, in my final year of medical school I was in Lithgow, which is just past the Blue Mountains in New South Wales. In Lithgow, there are three or four rural generalists, who do a bit of emergency, a bit of anaesthetics, a bit of obstetrics. I was so amazed by the diversity of their work and what they could accomplish. The town itself has a population of 9,000 people and everyone was so grateful when these doctors were around. That just clicked for me - I realised I wanted to be useful to a community. I also wanted that work life balance where you’ve got a house not far from the hospital and you have a decent sized place for your kids to run around. Until you see a person that is living the life that you want to be living, you probably won’t actually be fully converted. I saw the life they were living and knew that’s what I wanted to do.</Blog.Text>\n            <br /> \n            <br /> \n            <Blog.Subtitle>ADVOCACY WORK</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>Even before I got into medicine, there was always this idea that rural kids are more likely to go rural. From the beginning, I felt like I was on the back foot. I had to prove myself as someone who was actually committed even though I grew up in Sydney and was born overseas. The more I got involved in rural health, the more I got passionate about it. There’s seven million people that are living rurally at the moment. Their health outcomes are poorer, and people are having to travel long distances for care. There is a huge gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people.

Some patients are pretty much refusing to come in because they’re so scared that they’re going to pick something up. Now we’re experiencing people who are either passing away in their homes or people coming in with more advanced disease than we were seeing before. Everyone’s really worried about what it’s going to be like once we realize there’s so many people that are really, really unwell at home and refusing to come in.

I did two years of pediatric training and then got interested in child psychiatry. I decided to take a year off to reassess what I wanted to do - that's when I decided to go into general practice, despite initially thinking that I was not going to do general practice! I worked at a clinic in the outskirts of Melbourne, where I saw lots of children. Over that time I had my family: I had a set of twins and another baby 13 months later. The dual commitment of work and family was really busy and hectic!</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I continued in general practice including owning my own practice until my children were about 14. I wanted another challenge so I decided to go back to uni and study. I did a Master's of Women's Health and a PhD in sexual violence - this was really because of the patients I was seeing. I was seeing a lot of young mums who had issues with breastfeeding and early parenting that were linked with violence in their own early childhood. They did not know how to touch and hold and handle their own children and had fears around that.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I found that because nobody seemed to ask that question of why this was happening, I ended up doing the research myself so that I could answer my patients' questions. My career path was very much driven by the people I was seeing and feeling that my education was inadequate to serve them. I had to find out how to look after my patients properly.</Blog.Text>\n            <br /> \n            <br /> \n            <Blog.Subtitle>💬  Take the initiative and ask about family violence</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>From my experiences in the clinic, mothers want to be asked about it (previous family violence). They're often quite ashamed and guilty about what happened in their past. So it's very hard for them to say to you as their health practitioner: “Look, I was sexually abused as a child.” It's just too difficult for them. But if you take the initiative and ask, they are often quite relieved.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>You don’t have to start with a confronting question. It doesn't have to be: “were you raped as a child?” It can be something like “were you ever frightened as a child?” or “did anyone ever make you feel uncomfortable when you were little?”</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>As soon as you do that it's like the floodgates are opening. Or you'll see their faces shut off and they don't want to talk about it.</Blog.Text>\n            <br /> \n            <br /> \n            <Blog.Subtitle>⏱️ “The opportunity to see the healing that happens over time”</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I can still remember asking one of the new patients in my clinic who was in her forties and had a long history of psychiatric illness, “Have you ever been afraid?” She said, “Look, nothing, nothing has ever happened to me. I don't want to talk about it.”</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Around 12 months later she walked into my clinic and she told me, “You know that question you asked me 12 months ago? I'm ready to talk to you today.” Then she told me this story about having been abused by a stepfather. The important thing for practitioners is to not to feel like a failure when people can't open up or tell you straight away. It's often a very painful memory. When they are ready and if you give them permission to, they’ll take about it</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>The lovely thing about general practice is that since you have ongoing care of a patient, you get the opportunity to see the healing that happens over time.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Another patient, a young woman who couldn't breastfeed her baby as she used to get frightened by her baby’s smile, had been abused as a little girl by a male relative. The baby’s smile triggered her and made her fearful. It was nice being her GP and watching her learn over time that her baby’s smile wasn’t the same as her abuser’s smile. Over 14 years of practice I saw her relationship with her son develop into what I'd call a normal mum-adolescent relationship without that fear that crippled her when she had her little baby. It wasn't just me - she was involved with therapists and psychiatrists who were prepared to deal with the effects of family violence. She made a really great recovery and had a good relationship with her son and I got to see that. That's something special about being a general practitioner.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>It’s really important to recognise violence in women's lives early. There's a possibility that we can make a difference and change the future for them and their children.</Blog.Text>\n            <br /> \n            <br /> \n            <Blog.Subtitle>❔\"A lot of students think it's a social problem, it's not medical, so why should we bother?”</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>Family violence is a socially constructed thing, but it has a significant impact on mental health and physical health. For example there are chronic pain syndromes that follow various forms of family violence, depression and anxiety, that don’t get better if you just treat them as depression and anxiety. If you don’t identify the cause there is no point putting someone through various forms of therapy of anxiety. If she's still getting beaten at home, it's not going to get better. You're going to get frustrated about treating her unless you know the cause. You've got to know the cause to make a difference.</Blog.Text>\n            <br /> \n            <br /> \n            <Blog.Subtitle>🎉 Creating PACTS: An innovative award-winning Primary care Program Advancing Competency To Support family violence survivors</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I'd been in discussions with people at Monash University about how difficult it was to teach about family violence no one stepped up to be a champion. If there wasn't a member of staff who was prepared to teach about it, then it tended not to be taught. A lot of practitioners feel quite uncomfortable teaching about family violence when they don't know a lot about it or haven't experienced managing it.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>There's a whole group of practitioners that are first responders to family violence, who see it all the time. So we decided as a group of interprofessionals that we would work together and create a teaching package that we could all use.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>It was quite difficult to create a manual around how to teach it and how to respond to the students' questions. Male students often feel quite threatened. So it is very important to teach it in an inclusive way. Men are part of the solution as well as part of the problem; women can be part of the problem too.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>We included cases for paramedics units which is quite different to what we might see in a clinic in general practice, which is also different to what a social worker might see in a hospital. So we created stories that actually resonated with the different professions and spent quite a lot of time talking to patients. We also involved the Domestic Violence Resource Centre and patient advocates from the community. It was important to have patient voices.</Blog.Text>\n            <br /> \n            <br /> \n            <Blog.Subtitle>🌐 From patients in the clinic to going across the world - mind blowing!</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>We were really pleased with what we created in the end. It won the Dean's Award for Teaching Excellence and also the University Award for Teaching Excellence. That was pretty exciting. The World Health Organisation used some of our videos in their education as another way of teaching family violence in resource poor countries.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>It's mind blowing, when you think of yourself as a GP in a clinic seeing the same patients every day, to then taking an issue that those patients faced and creating some knowledge and teaching resources around it, and then have it go to the World Health Organisation! You don't think that your work will ever end up like that. Yet in some ways it's those little girl dreams that you go into medicine for to make a difference, and then when that happens you go “Oh wow”.</Blog.Text>\n            <br /> \n            <br /> \n            <Blog.Subtitle>🔮 The future of family violence - We still need to be active and be agents for change.</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>The problem is not going to go away quickly. It is multifaceted and there are all sorts of factors behind why it happens. I think certainly the work in prevention is really important. This is what the Give Respect project is all about – promoting respectful behaviours amongst university students as a way to prevent violence.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>While the focus will be on prevention, as clinicians we are still going to be dealing with the effects. We will need to know what to do in clinical practice, whether we are surgeons or rheumatologists dealing with chronic pain, or psychiatrists. There's still more work that needs to be done on best practice responses and how to best work with patients and at the community level.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>As general practitioners, we all know that prevention is the most important thing in general practice work.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>One of the evolving concepts within the family violence realm is better understanding diversity across cultures and disability. We know that we are not very well informed in how to respond to culturally appropriate ways. Diversity and inclusion needs to be handled better.</Blog.Text>\n            <br /> \n            <br /> \n            <Blog.Subtitle>🏥 Why all doctors need to be aware of these issues.</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>In patients where nothing seems to be working, you have to really think to yourself, “is there something else going on?” In general practice we call it a red flag. Although it may not be a physical condition, there may be a serious social condition underlying why these patients are here all the time. Even if you don't know what to do, you don't have to do anything as long as you ask that gentle question in a caring way and then refer the patient appropriately. You're not responsible for the treatment in that case. But as I have said early on, it's about opening the door.</Blog.Text>\n            <br /> \n            <br /> \n            <Blog.Subtitle>📚 Research and Medical Education- “it gave me the space where I could think and be more creative than in clinical medicine.”</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I love my clinical work. I really enjoy seeing patients, but I must say that teaching students is just as much fun. There are similar challenges: trying to get people interested in learning, when they sometimes really didn't want to. It's a bit like trying to get a patient to take therapy when they don't really want to.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Research was really important to me in that it gave me a space where I could think and be more creative than in clinical medicine. I suppose the creative part has always been really important to me. I felt that my creative side was neglected in clinical medicine. The transition across wasn't difficult - I was ready for a new challenge!</Blog.Text>\n            <br /> \n            <br /> \n            <Blog.Subtitle>💡 Advice for medical students and junior doctors: “Don't be afraid to take something you find at the coalface that you can't find an answer for.”</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>My advice would be, for anything you're interested in and think is important - don’t just follow your heart, but be passionate about it. Even when people say to you, as my head of department said to me when I was starting my PhD: “Oh, please, would you do medical workforce? It's so much more important than sexual violence.” I just looked at him and said, “I can't, because my patients don't talk about medical workforce but they do talk about sexual violence.” So just to be prepared to have your beliefs challenged and for people to say to you that you are doing the wrong thing.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I knew my patients thought it was really important, so I was prepared to fight for it because it's what I was seeing at the coalface. I think people will challenge you in areas like this. They will say to you that it's the wrong work to be doing. But I've never been afraid of not having the same path as my colleagues. I would tell students and young doctors, if there's something that you feel is really important, don't be afraid if the medical establishment doesn't think the same. Go for it. Just go for it and make a difference to the people you see.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Don't be afraid to take something you find at the coalface that you can't find an answer for. Don't be afraid to take that forward and be prepared to learn new things and create new knowledge.</Blog.Text>\n            <br /> \n            <br /> \n        </Blog.TextBlock>\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\nimport { Blog } from '../../components';\n\nexport default function thailand_covidsation() {\n    return (\n        <Blog.TextBlock>\n            <Blog.Text>In this feature we interview Nitis (Nine) Rattanagitpaisan, a third year medical student at the Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, Thailand, and learn about the COVID situation in Thailand and its impact on local medical student.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Subtitle>Can you tell me a bit about the current situation in Thailand? </Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>It’s getting better since the government launched the self-quarantine law in April.

However residencies require you to do the internship, so sometimes it’s not in our interest to pay and get out of the internship. After internship we can apply for three-year residencies in specific fields - pediatrics, surgery, etc. After residency we can apply for two-to-four year fellowships to specialise further, in pediatric cardiology for example.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Subtitle>Have you noticed any positive changes that come out from the COVID situation? </Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>Of course I’ve seen many positive changes happen because of COVID.

By the end of that first year of unaccredited paediatric training, I became pregnant with my first child. I defaulted back to general practice as it was the only speciality you could do part-time. I actually really enjoyed it. I found the variety and the kinds of things you could do in primary care much more comprehensive and intersectional. I almost completed general practice training which included a term and a half of special skills in adolescent medicine. Then a position became available for a GP in a multidisciplinary primary care health service that looked after homeless young people. I decided to apply for that. I was told by the college and GPs that I had already done too much adolescent medicine in my GP training, and that I would have to decide whether to stop short of completing GP training. I made that decision and I stuck with this job in a youth health service. Later I was offered a position in the department of Adolescent Medicine at The Children’s Hospital in Sydney. I ended up becoming a clinician in a specialty service, even though I was not trained as a paediatrician. I was incredibly lucky. I did the same clinics as the paediatricians - patients with chronic and complex illnesses like eating disorders. The only difference was that I didn’t have any admitting rights. I felt like I’d landed my dream job really. I was granted vocational registration, so I call myself a GP but I’m not really a GP. It is a bit like adolescence - I’m not quite sure who I am. </Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Way back in 1993, when I was still working as a GP registrar in the special skills adolescent medicine post, I met a GP who was answering questions for Dolly Doctor. She was one of a series of GPs who belonged to the New South Wales Association for Adolescent Health. They had been contracted by Dolly Magazine to use their medical members to answer questions. She would sometimes ask me what I thought and if I’d like to answer some. Then after a few months, she asked would I be interested in taking over. I grabbed it and for 23 years I never let go.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Subtitle>~BEING DOLLY DOCTOR~</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>It was not a huge amount of work each month, but I really, really loved it. I would labour over every single question. I would look up textbooks. I would ring up specialists to help me make sure I had everything absolutely right. It felt like a huge responsibility. You couldn’t afford to get anything wrong. Sometimes I would share some questions around the table at work with the multidisciplinary team I was working with. I had fantastic advice and suggestions from some of my allied health and social worker colleagues. They were really good at taking a very holistic approach to answering the question. </Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>It was a real interaction between a readership and a magazine. They didn’t know who I was. I was semi-anonymous. They just had my first name. It was this weird Twilight Zone, I guess.  It was a really interesting and challenging way of interacting with the same population I was working with clinically. There was this outpouring of concerns, desperation, anxiety, guilt and sometimes shame from readers to this trusted source of Dolly Doctor. So I was just trying to address whatever it was and normalize it, or put it into context. Then I would also try and see if there were any resources. Back in those days there were no websites, but there were places that adolescents could go for more information. There was a very big readership, so even if someone’s question wasn’t directly relevant to another adolescent, maybe the answer would be. And I have to say, in 23 years, I never used the same answer. It was just about being really sensitive and careful how I answered. Which was challenging to do when you’re not face to face with someone and you’ve only got 250 words.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Subtitle>~WORKING FOR DOLLY MAGAZINE~</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>Dolly Magazine, in my understanding of magazine media was considered the entry point for a lot of aspiring magazine writers and editors. The staff turnover was pretty high, and the staff was very young. I met lots of different people over the years. They only published five questions a month, for most of the years, and then they increased it to ten. For a few years they also published boys’ questions. There were never very many, but there was some. There was an editor that was there for the longest time. We had quite a good relationship in the sense that she was very keen to expand the health section in the magazine and look at what readers were really asking for. When I was working at the Children’s Hospital in adolescent medicine, I asked the editor if their staff might come and do a Dolly Day in the adolescent ward. We did that for a couple of years in a row. The staff would come and do makeovers and just chat to the kids in hospital. One year, they had one of their top male models come as well. That was a bit of a highlight. I had some really nice memorable times working for them. There was a particular era when the magazine was obviously doing really well. </Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>In the last five years as a magazine they started to become non-viable financially, like a lot of magazines really. They changed the model to save costs. They no longer wanted me as the medical consultant solely. They wanted to rotate the questions each month through panels of experts, including representatives from organizations like Beyond Blue. I think the problem was, I would have kept doing it for no money at all, but they couldn’t justify that. For the last couple of years, I was only answering questions every two months. I maintained a relationship with them right up until the end, but it was a pretty sad and sorry office the last time I visited, about two months before they shut down in December 2016. The number of questions they were receiving was drastically dropping. The whole thing was clearly dying.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Subtitle>~LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE LETTERS~</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I have thousands of letters sitting in boxes at home, which is incredible. I ended up doing some qualitative research analysing the content readers were writing in about. The things that they were concerned about were not the sorts of things that they would go and talk to a doctor about. And often also not the sorts of things that would be taught about in standard sex education in schools.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>The thing is that as doctors, we may or may not even inquire about pubertal development. GPs may or may not ask about menarche in a girl. Whereas, to Dolly Doctor, there were questions about everything: breast development, breast symptoms, breast asymmetry, stretch marks, labia, pubic hair, acne, weight gain, physical growth in general; and then of course, a lot of questions about periods and vaginal secretions. A lot of them were tied into either body image, or concerns about sexual attractiveness. Most of the readers of Dolly Magazine were young and therefore not sexually active, but they were thinking about when they would become sexually active. The girls who were already having sex would often ask about the lack of orgasm and sometimes discomfort with penetrative sex. There was always a large proportion of questions about same sex attraction or believing that they were probably lesbian or gay, and a lot of questions about masturbation. I guess what it’s taught me is that I need to ask about these things in my clinical work. Of course only when it feels appropriate, but as a general question: “Are there any things about your puberty that worry you such as skin changes and breast development?” I think it’s good to put things out on the table and give patients the opportunity to ask about it if they want.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Subtitle>~ADVICE TO MEDCAL STUDENTS REGARDING ADOLESCENTS AND BEYOND~</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>Adolescence is a time of life that’s intense and private in lots of ways. I think it’s a real privilege if an adolescent takes us into their confidence. Also explaining and understanding the exceptions or boundaries around that is really important. I think the other thing is to be willing to have slightly stilted and slow conversations. I think we learn how to take histories really well in medicine that are around specific symptoms. It’s not always going to be that easy to get some of that information out of adolescent patients, particularly if they’re feeling very anxious or a bit angry about being there in the first place. It can be very, very challenging. Just learning to sit with a little bit of discomfort when there are silent pauses in conversation, or learning how to acknowledge that sense of awkwardness that might be in the room, is a positive step. I always say, if you can engage an adolescent in conversation within a medical consultation, you can engage anybody. It’s not because there’s anything wrong with them. It’s just that they’re learning how to be their own health advocates and their own health reporters, who have so far had their parents doing it for their whole lives. </Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>If you have any opportunity to talk to an adolescent on their own in your hospital placements, have a chat to them with their permission. Learn how to take a psychosocial history. Practice with them. Practice making confidentiality statements. It will benefit you. And any opportunity for a young person to have a private and confidential chat where someone who is genuinely interested in things other than their particular disease can benefit them too. The practice of medicine first and foremost is about humans. Every time you talk to a patient, relish and refine your skills in learning how to understand humans. I think that will stand you in good stead, whatever you end up doing.</Blog.Text>\n        </Blog.TextBlock>\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\nimport { Blog } from '../../components';\n\nexport default function bronwyn_king() {\n    return (\n        <Blog.TextBlock>\n            <Blog.Author>Interviewed and Written by Jefferson Tang</Blog.Author>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <em><Blog.Text>Dr Bronwyn King AO is a specialist Radiation Oncologist, founder and CEO of Tobacco Free Portfolios, a former elite swimmer and Team Doctor for the Australian Swimming Team.

I was completely transfixed. I couldn’t stop looking at the picture and trying to work out which muscles I needed to focus on in the gym to make me swim faster. I got a photocopy of that picture and put it up on my bedroom wall. That really sparked my curiosity about the human body and health and sport, and how important it was to be in good shape and to have a healthy life.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />  \n            <Blog.Subtitle>THE ART OF RESILIENCE 💪 - <em>“There are so many things in life that have not gone as I would have wanted them to.”</em></Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>In my teenage years I was an elite swimmer representing Australia at a junior level. My dream then was to be a champion swimmer for Australia. Instead I didn’t even make it to the trials for the 1992 Barcelona Olympics because I developed a serious shoulder injury the year before. That was devastating to me as a 17 year old. It was really, really disappointing. </Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>When I first got to university I found the style of studying challenging. I did medicine at Melbourne Uni and one of our first subjects was chemistry. The lectures would sometimes include more than 100 pages of references at the end. I thought you needed to know everything included in those references. By the end of semester I was only up to week two! So…I ended up failing my first exam at university. I got myself a tutor and he spent the first hour laughing at what I had done. He went on to explain that I only needed to know the exact content presented in the lecture. I turned out fine and finished the year with a H1 in chemistry. </Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>That experience taught me a lot about failure and about how you just have to pick yourself up and learn another way. In the end, as long as you look at it as a learning opportunity, it really doesn’t matter. I’m inherently very optimistic and very positive. I see possibility. I believe in things. </Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Now with Tobacco Free Portfolios, the organisation I run, we have challenges all the time. It is very rare for anyone who’s executing any project to go directly from point A to point B. It’s almost a certainty that there will be hurdles and barriers, perhaps predictable but perhaps not. I have learned to perfect ‘the sidestep’ - just sidestep around it and keep going forwards. It might take some time. It might take you down a different path. It might challenge you enormously. You might have to draw on all sorts of resources and advisors and reconsider the foundation of what it is that you’re doing. If, however, you can keep your eye on the long-term goal, ultimately that will put you in a much better place.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />  \n            <Blog.Subtitle>BATTLING CRITICISM FROM PEERS 🛡️</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>When I started Tobacco Free Portfolios it was just so fascinating to me that I found I couldn’t stop. I was really motivated to take it on because I had seen with my own eyes the injustice that tobacco inflicted on people. Then to think that people all over the world were unknowingly investing in these companies and only making worse the very problem that we were trying to fix…. it was something that seemed too big to just put aside.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Early on, many colleagues thought it was silly and that I was being distracted from the ‘real’ work of research. I was told to reconsider what I was doing and that I was making a terrible mistake. When the very first super fund in Australia went tobacco free in the middle of 2012, there was a fantastic public announcement. It was a good news story for the hospital. It was a good news story for the super fund. Everyone was very happy. It was First State Super and they had got rid of $200 million worth of tobacco investments. </Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>That night I got a beautiful email from the Director of the lung cancer service at Peter MacCallum – Professor David Ball. He had been a mentor of mine for a long time and he wrote, “By this action you will save more lives than in an entire lifetime as a clinician. Keep up the great work.” For me, that was just the nicest thing in the world that anybody could say. It was like a shield because any time after that I received negative comments, I would think to myself, ‘if Professor Ball thinks it’s a good idea then it probably is.’ </Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>It really showed me the power of a mentor. For senior doctors out there, honestly, one sentence can totally change the life of somebody your junior. I think we need to be better at making sure we deliver compliments when they’re deserved and allow junior doctors to really blossom.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />  \n            <Blog.Subtitle>THE METHOD BEHIND TOBACCO FREE PORTFOLIOS </Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I used my experiences as a cancer specialist to bring patient stories to life by telling them to senior leaders in the finance sector. It’s very rare for people to be fully informed about tobacco and to not do anything about it. I always kept the conversations very apolitical and very respectful. I just try to nudge people in the right direction. I had to learn a lot about when to push and when to just sit tight. Sometimes the timing was just not right, so I would just back off and wait a little bit. I had to be very patient, but I got support from within the sector, mainly in Australia first. </Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Then when I started looking overseas, I had direct introductions at the very highest levels. People felt really good after working with us. Our mantra at Tobacco Free Portfolios is that we ‘name and fame’. When organisations choose to go tobacco free, we’re the first ones to offer them compliments. We might help them arrange an event so that they can get some great publicity from it. Ultimately it creates this win-win situation. They feel good, we feel good, and the whole global movement is driven forward.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>It’s been one of our defining strategies – people have constantly come back to us at Tobacco Free Portfolios and told us we were genuinely collaborative, we wanted to achieve a great goal together, and we wanted to work through any barriers and challenges together. They really appreciate that sentiment of positivity and community spirit. We’re extremely grateful for the great relationships that we’ve got in finance, which has meant that they’ve opened their networks to us. Not just in Australia, but now all over the world.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />  \n            <Blog.Subtitle>FITTING IN EXERCISE IN A CRAZY SCHEDULE 🏃♀️</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>Exercise has been so difficult to fit into the crazy disrupted life I’ve been living. I’ve explored all sorts of options. For me the only thing I could do was bring the gym to me because I could just never get to a gym. My personal trainer actually fired me! She told me, “What’s the point? You keep cancelling on me because you’re away for this or that. It’s not going to work.” So, after that, I got a cross trainer, a stationary bike, weights, a Swiss ball, a yoga mat, that’s all at home and sitting right beside me in the office. I just try to do a little bit each day. I don’t need to do a two-hour workout every day. If I can just do 20 or 30 minutes a day, then that really boosts not just my physical, but also my mental health. I really encourage people to do whatever it is that fits in with their own lifestyles, whether that’s joining exercise groups or walking with a friend.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />  \n            <Blog.Subtitle>ADVICE FOR JUNIORS: <em>“Just keep stepping forwards. The path is forming under your feet.”</em></Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>Even though the COVID-19 crisis seems overwhelming to say the least, the world will get through it in one way or another. It’s pretty normal to have good days and bad days - everybody I know in business, government, diplomacy, medicine, sport is having good days followed by bad days. </Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>One of my colleagues in Tobacco Free Portfolios gave me this great quote, which I think will resonate with med students who are working out where they’re going in the years and decades ahead. It was about five years ago, when Tobacco Free Portfolios was just starting to expand overseas. I told my colleague, “Look, I don’t know where I am going with this.” She said to me, “Just keep stepping forwards. The path is forming under your feet.” I think it’s such a nice quote, because it really embraces that concept of uncertainty. I didn’t know exactly where I was going. I knew that I was being drawn to good things, and that the path was forming as I made it. You don’t have to follow a set path - you can create your own path. It’s also okay if that path has a few dead ends and you sidestep onto another route. </Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I think that being a doctor is a remarkably rewarding and interesting and challenging and fulfilling career. I don’t think I’ve ever met a doctor who has regretted the years that they’ve spent as a doctor or in medicine. It’s one of the most interesting and satisfying professions I think anyone could ever have. It’s a wonderful career to have in front of you. I think you should really be open to whatever opportunities there are, but ultimately find something that really fits you. Find something that you love. The very best scenario is to wake up in the morning and feel energized about going to work. You should want to get there and you should feel great satisfaction in what you do.</Blog.Text>\n        </Blog.TextBlock>\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\nimport { Blog } from '../../components';\n\nexport default function allison_hempenstall() {\n    return (\n        <Blog.TextBlock>\n            <Blog.Author>Interviewed and Written by Jasmine Davis</Blog.Author>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text>Dr Allison Hempenstall is a rural generalist living on Thursday Island in the Torres Strait working for the Torres and Cape Hospital and Health Service.

I wasn’t really sure, and so I just copied every else’s answer! It wasn’t until I completed my honors research year based in a lab that I decided to go into medicine.

It wasn’t until I was a junior doctor that I was exposed to rural medicine. I rotated to Swan Hill as an intern and completed a rotation there in the emergency department. I was so amazed at the skills of the emergency doctors running the department. They weren’t trained emergency specialists; they were rural generalists. That meant that they could do a little bit of everything: primary care, emergency, anesthetics, obstetrics. I thought it was so cool that you could do all these things in one job.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>During my rotation in Swan Hill, I met one particular rural generalist who used to come into the emergency department and play the ukulele. He learned the ukulele when he had spent time on Thursday Island. I was enthralled by his experiences in this place called the Torres Strait. It was then that I decided to move to Cairns, so I could undertake a rotation on Thursday Island as the emergency department resident. It’s a very small emergency department with only two resuscitation bays and another three rooms. I absolutely loved the rotation and everything that this place had to offer. </Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Subtitle>TRAINING WITH ACRRM</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>When training with the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine (ACRRM), you develop a broad range of skills including primary care, emergency care, pediatrics, obstetrics, and anesthetics. ACRRM also enables you to develop a specialist skill, for me this is in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health, which really fits with the work that I do up here in the Torres Strait. There is so much variety in the training program and plenty of flexibility in jobs after you obtain fellowship.

Primary care offers the opportunity to care for patients, their families and communities over a long period of time. Being able to care for patients when they are admitted to hospital and then see them again once they have recovered and are back in the community is deeply rewarding.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Subtitle>WORKING ON THURSDAY ISLAND</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>There are fifteen doctors who live and work across the Torres Strait. Most of us are based on Thursday Island, and we provide outreach clinics to all the outer islands. There are fifteen different other islands each with their own primary health care centre run by 1-2 rural area nurses and 1-2 health workers. These communities often will only see a doctor once a week or once a fortnight. I think the most valuable life lesson I’ve learned living in the Torres is the value of community. Western culture promotes individualism, whereas community is a core value within the Torres Strait Islander culture. Here everyone works together for the collective good of the community. It certainly is special to be included in this community and culture. </Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Subtitle>CLIMATE CHANGE</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I believe our government should focus more on climate change than they have to date.

Of course, everything in life has been put on hold with the current pandemic. I really hope that after COVID19, we can look at a more sustainable future with renewable energy sources, because it’s communities such as those in the Torres Straits that are affected first. We are already seeing changes in sea life patterns. We are already seeing the impacts of rising sea levels. We are already seeing the health implications that climate change is having on the community.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Subtitle>CORONAVIRUS</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>As of March 2020 the Torres and Cape Hospital has not had any cases, but we can’t rest on our laurels.

I’d encourage all patients to continue to visit their general practitioners to ensure their health checks are up to date.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Many important primary health programs in the Torres and Cape have reduced capacity as staff have been redeployed to help in the COVID-19 pandemic. These include diabetes educators, allied health, mental health workers and most importantly our Indigenous health workers. They all run programs on different islands to promote healthy lifestyles and help support our communities’ chronic diseases. As a result of this pandemic, we’ve had to significantly limit travel between the islands, and many of these primary care services have limited capacity for the time being. Of course, that’s for the safety of the community and we anticipate that these services will recommence in the near future. </Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Subtitle>ADVICE FOR MEDICAL STUDENTS</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>Don’t worry about knowing what you want to do by the time you finish medical school.

Thank you for joining us. I’m here today with Dr. David Lam, who is a GP Fellow and was the RACGP GP of the Year in 2019. We will start right back at the beginning. What made you want to become a doctor? </em></strong></Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><strong>Dr David Lam: </strong>Well, if I am completely honest, I didn’t even want to be a doctor in the first place. Coming out of high school, I wanted to go to The Elder Conservatorium of Music in Adelaide to study jazz. But I was a bit unsure as to what career pathways that would lead me to thereafter, and so not really knowing what I wanted to do, I actually ended up signing up for law school. Did a year of that, and loved that, but for complete curiosity's sake, I also applied to and got into medical school at the University of Adelaide... and here I am. </Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><strong><em>Erica: That’s awesome. Quite an unconventional path, I guess. From doing your medical studies, how did you find your way into general practice? Was that always something that interested you, or did it come about through a series of random events? </em></strong></Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><strong>Dr David Lam: </strong>It was absolutely not what I always wanted to do. This is probably a pretty familiar story. Like a lot of young males in medical school, I wanted to do surgery. It seemed a logical choice. I’m keen on music and boxing. I like to solve matters with, in both of those areas, with my own two hands. I thought, why should medicine be any different? You have a bowel cancer? Well, I’ll chop it out with my own two hands. My surgical training plan at the time was essentially contingent on that stupid, childish unproductive side hustle of playing guitar evaporating when I finished medical school and became a grown up. Unfortunately, quite the opposite happened. </Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>As I went through my medical career, I found myself gigging more and more actually. By the time I was in my final year of medical school, I’d released an EP. In that year I had learned how to DJ as well and started actually play in the clubs in Adelaide. Then I started touring interstate, getting contracts with Port Adelaide Football Club to play at their home games, et cetera. Juggling that and the hospital shifts was really quickly becoming an unsustainable task. I was forced to make some hard career decisions. For example, there was no way I could tour if I was required in theatre all the time. One of the most underrated benefits of general practice, I find, is the flexibility. Now, I can tailor my work hours around tours and do what I want to do. </Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><strong><em>Erica: I totally agree. What does your day to day look like, or maybe week to week, and what are the best and worst parts of your job? </em></strong></Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><strong>Dr David Lam: </strong>Sure. It is a bit different from me compared to somebody who lives in a metropolitan area. I guess for the benefit of your followers not from South Australia: I live and work in a town called Port Lincoln, which is a town of 16,000 people. I guess the hardest part working there is that I am 650 kilometers away from the nearest major hospital. That means - and this is quite typical of a lot of South Australian towns – that the GPs working in those towns don’t just deal with the GP clinic stuff like their counterparts in the metropolitan areas, but they also look after patients in the hospitals. They do all the emergency department work as well, or certainly I do in Port Lincoln. We also look after the inpatients as well in the hospital. That means that I do spend a fair bit of work time day to day doing the medical stuff. The average day would start off with me doing a ward round with my registrars and the medical students and checking on our patients in the hospital first and foremost. Then I’ll go off to clinic and see patients in the clinic and sort them out there. Then I’ll usually end the day with a ward round to see how everybody has been going back in hospital, because unfortunately I couldn’t be physically there the whole day. </Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Each of the doctors in our town take it in turn to be on call at the emergency department. If somebody comes in with an emergency, like a heart attack or stroke or broken arm, then they’ll call us and we will deal with that. On a civilized day, everything happens in a nice planned order, but it’s very rarely a civilized day. Because at the end of the day, if somebody is having a heart attack or stroke in hospital, I will literally have to stop what I’m doing in clinic and go sort that out. People are very good about it, particularly in the country. I will quite routinely say to patients, “Sorry, I’ve got to go. There’s an emergency. I’ll see you in four hours.” And they will very patiently wait that time. Because they have the trust in us that if it was them on the other side, in the hospital, then we would come straight to them. People in the country are very good about it. Certainly that does make my job as a doctor working in that area pretty tough. </Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><strong><em>Erica: That leads quite nicely into my next question, about rural medicine. What do you like about rural medicine versus metropolitan medicine, and what would you say to people who are skeptical about doing medicine in a rural town, or maybe the lifestyle there? </em></strong></Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><strong>Dr David Lam: </strong>Fair question. From a medicine point of view, it is just interesting as all hell! In like a town like mine, where I’m at least 650 kilometers away from any of the nearest specialists, it’s not just my town we look after. We’re one of the bigger towns in the area. People from towns of with even smaller populations drive over to see me. Because of that, you’re dealing with a whole lot of cool, interesting cases that you would otherwise not deal with in the city. Stuff like car crashes, strokes and heart attacks, stuff like very, very bad footy injuries. </Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I think everybody should, at some point in their career whether that be as a student or a doctor, practice in a rural area, because of the experience. In terms of the skeptics, I think the two biggest misconceptions are: one, that you’re dealing with medicine that’s not relevant to the city. Then if you had to go back to the city, you wouldn’t know how to deal with stuff. I reckon it’s quite the opposite because again, you’re here and you have to deal with all of it. I found out that I was quite a bit smarter after coming off country rotations than the others. I think the other thing that’s worthwhile mentioning, which is arguably the best part about doing rural practice, is that because there’s not that many doctors or students there, the ratio of people looking to learn and people there wanting to teach is quite a lot better in your favour. That means that if you’re in a country town like mine, there’s eight of them (students), with 20 doctors ready to teach them. You get a lot of one-on-one mentorship that you otherwise wouldn’t in the city where the ratio is completely reversed, and there’s literally hundreds of medical students all following around the same consultant. </Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><strong><em>Erica: Now on to the RACGP GP of the Year award that you were given last year.

Did you know you were nominated, and what did it feel like to have your work recognized in such a way? </em></strong></Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><strong>Dr David Lam: </strong>Thank you. I’m still not quite sure what happened. There’s a good 30,000 GPs across the nation, and I’m sure there’s far better ones than me out there. Technically speaking, looking at the fine print, it looks like they were judging people on their clinical pursuits, their commitment to the ongoing development of general practice, their commitment to medical education and to bettering services for patients and then also innovative ways to do things. To be honest, it was actually a secret nomination, so I still don’t know who nominated me. </Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I do know that as part of the process, they often look for support from the local community or from your fellow colleagues, purely because I got a whole bunch of sneaky texts saying, “Just got asked to put it in a good word for you. I absolutely did.” It was really lovely to hear that there were lots of members of the community and lots of members of the profession that thought I was helping in a big way. It sounded like there were lots of different people, from high school kids that I have mentored and snuck into clinic with me to see how it all works, to patients, old and young, other GPs, or GP registrars that I train, medical students that I tutor, and nurses and allied health that I work with in the hospital. It was just really lovely to get that feedback that I was part of the team essentially. </Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><strong><em>Erica: That does sound pretty fantastic, but also well deserved. On the teaching side of things, I heard of you through my friends at Adelaide who just rave about you as a tutor. What do you like about teaching and how did you fall into or come to that role of being a tutor and someone passionate about medical education? </em></strong></Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><strong>Dr David Lam: </strong>By sheer accident. As a doctor you, not necessarily by choice, but me personally I love when it happens, you end up having medical students follow you around. You find if you give one medical student tips, they’ll tell the other medical students and all of a sudden you have multiple medical students following you around. What’s my mindset in teaching? Sadly, there’s been so many times in my career when I was made to feel like I was this big [small hand gesture] or not right for the job or would amount to nothing career wise. That just wasn’t fair. </Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I think as medical students and doctors we’ve all been in that scenario, more than once in our careers. I just didn’t think that was fair because there was often no constructive criticism, just anger or apathetic disdain from your supervisors. Sadly, it’s no wonder that we’ve got such a high rate of workplace bullying and suicide amongst younger workers in our profession. I really think that needs to stop. My teaching really literally just revolves me going around saying, “Hi, students and junior doctors. These are all the times I got burned. Here are some simple tips on how to avoid it.” People might not have necessarily said it out loud, but had they, it would have been a completely different ballgame. </Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><strong><em>Erica: Sticking with that theme of medical education, if you had a magic wand and you could change something about the way medical education was approached, what would you do? </em></strong></Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><strong>Dr David Lam: </strong>Well, this is purely based on the feedback that I get from students, which resonates with me from back in time I was a student or a registrar looking to learn. I don’t know, how controversial do you want me to be? I think we are very much fixated in this day and age in medical education on ‘self-directed learning’. I think there are some absolute benefits to encouraging you to be independent and being independent in utilizing resources and coming to an answer. I think there’s a big common misconception amongst a lot of educators out there that students and junior doctors just want to learn only for exams, and they are lazy or distractible, or otherwise just simply incompetent. I feel like this couldn’t be further from the truth. While I do think skills in terms of learning how to come up with the answers yourself and testing yourself and how you reason is important, I also think there is a role sometimes for just a one sentence answer. We just need somebody with that clinical experience to say, “Everybody shut up, this is the one sentence answer, and there we go.” I really think that my big advice to medical educators out there would be if a student or registrar is asking you a question is usually because they have tried to look the answer up themselves and is not a really obvious in the textbooks, not because they’re trying to shortcut the system. I guess that would be point number one. </Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>The second point is, sometimes unfortunately we as a medical profession because we are all pretty smart people, at the same time sometimes I think we overcomplicate things. We do this a lot with patients. We use too much jargon. We make too many lists of things. There’s that old saying out there that if you’re going to tell a patient something in the consultation, keep it to five things, and then do the rest on another day. Because if you say more than five things, they’re not going to remember that, they’re not medically trained. They’re not going to remember that. I think the same thing is applicable to medical education as well, and just education in general. For example, when I’m teaching somebody to box or teaching somebody how to play a piano, I don’t overload the student in the first lesson. I don’t start with this is how you should be playing a Beethoven Sonata, or this is how you should do a complex 8 punch combo. That’s just ridiculous. It’s more important that we master these first one or two basic steps, even though they are basic, and then we go from there. </Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><strong><em>Erica: I really agree with that and I appreciate it, because the amount of times I’ve tried to look stuff up and it’s not as simple as Googling it sometimes. </em></strong></Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><strong>Dr David Lam: Absolutely. I think to that end, because this is how I’d start off a lot of my teaching with students, I would tell them, “Guys, I’m not a smart guy. I like lists of only five things and algorithms that say: if it’s this, then do this, if this then do this.” I really think we should start making that a thing and start keeping the knowledge to bite-sized chunks, rather than have a big exhaustive list from Google, which is not easy to remember. I think we should just basically make things just lists of fives: here are the five most common differentials. Here are the five red flag differentials that could kill a person if you miss them. That’s it. </strong></Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><strong><em>Erica: Couldn't agree more. Outside of medicine, and you have touched on this already, so you’re a boxer and a successful and touring DJ. Can you tell us a bit more about those passions and how you make time for them around your career and around medicine? </em></strong></Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><strong>Dr David Lam: I don’t know where to start. Arguably, parts of me live more for that than for the medicine part. Boxing is lots of things to me. Boxing is about fitness, boxing is about staying healthy and that’s why I encourage it. I want to clarify I’ve not had any fights myself, but I certainly train very, very regularly and have done so for years. It’s something I certainly advocate to all my patients. It doesn’t matter whether you think you can or you can’t, you should take up boxing. Not to fight, but for the fitness and the cardio alone, my God, it’s just so life-changing health wise. For me, boxing and fight sports are also about confidence. Giving you that confidence that I can make my body do something if I want to. That’s something that I’d like to instill in all the patients as well. I guess the final thing for boxing is about family. One of the big reasons I came back to Port Lincoln after being a student here was because the boxing club. They’re essentially my family. Pete Williams is the head coach of the boxing club there. He’s basically like my father. I really love that club because if nothing else, they treat everybody the same. It doesn’t matter whether you’re the best fighter in the gym, or whether you’re just there training casually. The coach knows everybody by name and gives you the time of day. That’s very much the doctor that I want to be as well. Basically, the human being I want to be. </strong></Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>The music stuff, well, that’s just always been a part of my life. I loved violin and piano when I was young, then the DJ-ing just happened randomly. Essentially, I was my final year of medical school, when my brother came up with this hare-brained scheme that we should learn how to be DJs off YouTube and start touring. To his credit, he was a big driver of that and made sure that we both knew how to DJ and we had the right gear. And here we are. Certainly for me, the music is a big part of my life. It’s just very much a way for me to be me, and for me to show and tell other people how I’m really going inside much more than any other part of me. </Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I’d like to think that that’s partly why I get the feedback that I’m a decent doctor and a decent teacher as well, because I think the key to music, and to being a good touring DJ, is basically it’s all about reading other people and their reactions, or reading their body language and how they react to the way you’re playing. There’s a look in someone’s eyes when you play just the right banger, or when you play their favorite song. There’s a way they dance. There’s a way they just change. The not so great musicians and DJs don’t listen to people. They’re rigid, and they have their set list the way they want to do it and bugger everybody else. I think that’s silly. It defeats the purpose. </Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Music is art, and art is meant to be shared by everyone. I like to think it’s the same thing with medicine. Being a good doctor is the same, it’s all about reading people and their body language, not just the words that are coming out of their mouth. It’s about reading their reactions. If you don’t do that, you only push your agenda on what you think should happen, what you think is going on, what treatment you would choose, without any regard for how the patient is feeling or what their hopes and concerns are. I don’t think you get anywhere. </Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><strong><em>Erica: On a topical note, how has the COVID-19 pandemic impacted on you and your work? And what advice would you give to medical students who have had their year quite heavily affected by this situation? </em></strong></Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><strong>Dr David Lam: </strong>Absolutely. I mean, it’s just affected not just medicine, but life in general. It’s just been very, very sad with a lot of the things that are happening despite our best efforts. I guess from a clinical point of view, two things. At the end of the day, there are plenty of cases in medicine where there’s just no substitute to physically examining the patient yourself, in person, in real time to figure out what’s going on. Obviously, with the social distancing, there’s many more cases now where the risk of making the patient more sick rather than less sick applies, so you can’t do that part of your job properly. The second part is the preventative care aspect. One of the best parts about me being a GP is sorting out the problems before they become problems. That means keeping an eye out and sorting out problems before they become unfixable. With social distancing, there are a lot of times where I otherwise would have investigated something or sent somebody off to get surgically fixed for something, but I can’t now because it’s not urgent enough to risk someone getting sicker from coronavirus. That makes things very difficult and sad from a clinical point of view. </Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>From an educational point of view, unfortunately, there is just no substitute for hands on experience. I think that’s the best part about clinical experience is literally you will be the one doing the procedure. As a student in Port Lincoln, that’s where I learned how to deliver baby, because I literally had to deliver the baby with my bare hands. That’s where I learned how to do an anaesthetic because I literally had to do the anaesthetic intubation under supervision with my own two hands. Unfortunately, that’s just not an option with the social distancing. It certainly had its impact. I just wanted to say on behalf of us all, I’m very sorry. There is no substitute for hands on clinical teaching, but we have to put safety first. We’re trying our very best to educate despite social distancing. </Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>This is my biggest piece of advice that I had even before COVID for junior doctors and students, and that is keep asking lots of questions. As the student, keep asking lots of questions. There are no dumb questions, so ask them all. Even as a junior doctor, the big misconception out there is if I ask lots of questions, everybody in the hospital is going to think I’m dumb, and they will think I’m incompetent. Well, to be honest, that’s not the case. Because as this medical student, or as a junior medical officer, everybody assumes that you don’t know anything, and you don’t know what you’re doing anyway. You don’t have to worry about that. It’s quite the opposite. If you ask lots of questions, even as a doctor as a junior doctor, people will actually find you conscientious and be more keen to teach you. It’s that old saying of, if you don’t ask you will never know. </Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><strong><em>Erica: Lastly, what advice would you give to medical students and junior doctors just about their career in medicine in general and maintaining or pursuing interests that might be outside of that as well? </em></strong></Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><strong>Dr David Lam: </strong></Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>My big advice would basically be don’t ever let anybody tell you that you’re not right for the job. If you’re there, you’re right for the job. Don’t ever let anybody tell you that medicine is life and life in its entirety and there’s room for nothing else. I thought that music would just wither away and die, but quite the opposite has happened. Last year as a full time rural GP, I somehow managed to also tour six different states in Australia with my music. It’s a doable thing if you put your mind to it. </Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>My final note would be that I’ve recently created a free nine-episode podcast called “GP Lyf Hacks”, and it is basically me revealing all my doctor trade secrets and tips. I’ve made it a point to cover all those areas that are difficult to find in the textbooks, and not taught as in depth because they’re not considered content by the uni. Stuff like which painkillers to prescribe, which antibiotics to prescribe, which scans to order and those types of things. I would just encourage anybody out there who is interested, feel free to get in touch directly with me with any questions. None of them are too dumb. Keep asking questions because that’s how you learn. </Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <Blog.Text><strong><em>Erica: That’s brilliant.

When I started volunteering 10 years ago, I had no idea that I would start charities or work with such communities. It was initially just a journey to educate myself, and then once you’re immersed in an issue or idea for long enough you tend to notice ways in which you can contribute. It doesn’t even have to be starting your own project - a lot of medical students contribute through medical research, which is a really appropriate way to contribute.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>My greatest advice would be not to worry about where it’s leading or what you might achieve.

It’s an outcome of other problematic phenomena in society, such as family violence, mental illness, drug use, financial disadvantage and social isolation. Working in Psychiatry and through HoMie I’ve had a lot of exposure to some of the potential solutions and avenues for change - and you do see an optimistic trajectory in a number of areas. Over the past 5-10 years a lot of new services have been initiated. I do think that circumstances are getting better, but it’s a rocky road with numerous ups and downs. Despite that, this remains an issue that’s not even close to being resolved as there are still a lot of systemic issues that need to be solved first.  </Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />  \n            <Blog.Subtitle>COVID AND HOMELESSNESS</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>It’s been incredibly difficult for vulnerable people.

I think of a good friend who was studying medicine at James Cook University and started a program called “Run to Better Days”. They would run the length of Queensland and stop off at schools every day to provide educational seminars about poverty and effective altruism.

In my mind, I always thought that being a doctor was the fastest and easiest way to achieve that. The reason for that was my grandpa was a doctor and I grew up with him as a heavy influence. I went through that whole track of wanting to go to med school, eventually getting into med school, but then realising when I was on the wards that I couldn't have as much impact on the disadvantaged populations as I wanted to. Seeing what consultants did, although exciting, wasn't quite the exact same goal that I had since I was young. </Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>So I was a little bit lost in a way because I really liked being on the wards. I really enjoyed speaking to patients, but it wasn't as fulfilling. I'm so happy that I wasn't fulfilled.

Horus AI was essentially an automated platform to diagnose malaria on blood films. </Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>We found that a bottleneck from a global health space was that there weren't enough malaria diagnosticians- people who could diagnose what strain of malaria it is and quantify the malaria to know how serious the parasitaemia is on thick and thin blood films. </Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Some countries in sub-Saharan Africa were sending thick and thin blood films to Norway so that it could be read, because they didn't have enough staff. It took three to six months for the sides to return, which from a clinical perspective, was just absolutely crazy. Imagine sending a path test and getting the result back in three to six months. You wouldn't have any ability to treat the malaria properly- you wouldn’t even have an ability to find out if the patient has malaria, or track the spread of malaria. </Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>So we thought, this could be something that could be easily and very rapidly done by computer vision. So, myself, Matt Chan and Emily Yeung, who is another friend of mine (all doctors) founded a company. We started training an algorithm, and then managed to get some small seed funding. Unfortunately, what we didn't recognise was the challenges of implementation in the global health space. It is extremely challenging because you have so many different parties involved, different donors, different governments and different regulatory agencies. </Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Quote> \n                <em>\n                    So you can have the solution, but getting it to scale is extremely difficult. We learned a lot of lessons from that.\n                </em>\n            </Blog.Quote>\n            <br />\n            <br />  \n            <Blog.Subtitle>COLLABORATION IN MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY: med_hack</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>We looked at the medical technology space in Melbourne and thought, there's not enough collaboration between different parties. Can we create an event that brings together clinicians, engineers, businesses, business specialists (MBAs), designers as well as patients? If we could start to identify important clinical needs in Australia and then find solutions for them. By bringing in together the brains, we can come up with some really great ideas.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>Fortunately, while we were just students at that stage, the universities and hospitals really supported us-  provided funding and expert help. We found that there was a really big appetite in Melbourne for medical technology events, particularly ones that are collaborative. And since then, med_hack has been adopted by a student group at Monash (MYMI) that has managed to grow it into a very large hackathon. But unfortunately, the event has been cancelled this year because of the COVID pandemic. But, it's great to see something that we envisioned grow into something really big later on.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />  \n            <Blog.Subtitle>THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE IN A MEDTECH CAREER</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I think the hardest thing has actually been the environment, the resistance and the almost uphill fight. I've had quite a lot of strange looks when I say I have trained as a medical doctor and practiced as a medical doctor, but want to do medical devices with technology. </Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Quote> \n                <em>\n                    People always go: “Is that a specialty? Is it not a specialty? What does that actually mean?” \n                </em>\n            </Blog.Quote>\n            <Blog.Text>So in terms of role models and environment, it's been really difficult. There's very few role models in Australia for medical clinicians who are also engineers. There was actually a cohort or several cohorts, I believe, from Monash, where they polited a program, in the 70s or 80s, where they trained medical doctors as well as engineers- so there were people who graduated as medical doctors who were also trained in engineering. I've actually met one of those graduates from Monash Health who is now working as a cardiologist, but also trained as an electrical engineer. </Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>So I can probably count on the back of my hand how many medical engineers there are. While they do exist,  a network doesn't exist, mentorship doesn't exist, role models don’t exist. With the new generation of medical students, there's a lot of students who are asking what can I do beyond clinical practice? Particularly as specialist training programs are just getting harder to get into- the numbers are so restricted. Even once you finish a training program, it's really hard to get a specialist job these days. So there's a lot of people who are asking, can I use my skills better instead of spending 10 years trying to get into a training program? So I think the biggest challenge I've had to face is culture and role models. But the tide is shifting. We just need more people working in the area and supporting each other.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>From a talent perspective, talent is very hard to find in Australia in terms of medical devices and medical technology. But, I'm finding more and more particularly young doctors who are very open to working in the space because they know the technology can provide significant benefits for patients if used and developed correctly.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />  \n            <Blog.Subtitle>LOOKING TO THE FUTURE: BIOTECH IS THE NEW SOFTWARE</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>Where I see myself ... probably I'll just be running a medical device technology company. There's nothing quite like creating your own company or working for a company whose mission you believe in. That is a really fulfilling experience. </Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>In terms of where the medical device and technology space will be in five to ten years, that's obviously really hard to guess. But medical AI is likely to be much larger, neuro engineering is going to be much larger. So we might start seeing really early stage brain computer interfaces of some level. Then there's also bioengineering- essentially the engineering at a cellular level. There's also some really exciting stuff from the genetic side, from a synthetic biology side. We might start seeing some really interesting treatments that we've never thought of or never seen for diseases like cancer and chronic diseases. It's a really fast growing industry. In Silicon Valley, people have started to recognise that biotech is the new software. So we'll probably see some exciting things that I cannot predict currently.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />  \n            <Blog.Subtitle>LEAVING THE CLINICAL INDUSTRY: MEDICINE IS THE BIGGEST SAFETY NET YOU CAN HAVE</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>It does take a lot of courage to leave the medical and clinical industry once you start clinical practice. I feel like one should at least finish internship so that they get enough clinical experience, because being a doctor is obviously really different from being a medical student on the wards. </Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>But once you do that, it is a leap of faith in terms of switching to a different field where there's a lot more uncertainty in your life. You no longer have a stable job. But one of the best advice I've heard, and this is really lucky because I heard this really early on in my career from Sandro Demaio, he said that: “Medicine is essentially a field where you actually have the biggest safety net you can possibly have.” The reason for that is that your ability to locum means that you can essentially obtain money really fast. No other career has that safety net. No other career allows you to suddenly earn one hundred dollars per hour as soon as you are registered.</Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>There is so much security if you want to switch to medical technology or medical devices. Because in the case that you fail, you simply earn a hundred dollars an hour the next day. There's no job that has that sort of security. </Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Quote> \n                <em>\n                If anything, doctors should be taking more risks for things like public health or medical innovation, because the possibility that you might push the envelope can be quite high, particularly if you already have clinical training.\n                </em>\n            </Blog.Quote>\n            <Blog.Text>So I've always sort of kept that in mind, because a lot of my friends ask “how are you going to earn money?”. Well if I need money, I can just locum right? That is a really great resource for doctors. </Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>You don't have to make that leap of faith suddenly. It's so much easier if you start building a foundation in terms of advising for medical technology companies, seeing if it's the right field for you, starting to develop skills in that field. I think I see a lot of doctors assume that because they do clinical practice, they can suddenly switch over to medical technology and suddenly have the skills that people have built up over years or decades of practice- this is not the case. You need to start building up those skills early. You look at different sides of the problem when you are in clinical practice versus when you are a technologist or an engineer. So, you really have got to build it up and at some point take the leap of faith, knowing that you will have a safety net in the case things do fail.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />  \n            <Blog.Subtitle>HOW TO BALANCE MEDTECH AND A CLINICAL CAREER IN MEDICINE?</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I wish I could say that you could do 50-50, but I've never seen anyone do it. A lot of the people I've spoken to and from what I see, do a 90-10 split at most, or maybe even 80-20, if you're lucky. So you have to decide whether you want 80 percent in clinical practice and the other 20 percent advising companies, founding companies but not doing anything afterwards or managing small time projects. Or if you want 80 percent to be on the medical technology side, you can actually get to do proper engineering, found and build companies and solve actual medical technology problems; then 20 percent you locum every now and practice a little bit. Unfortunately I haven't ever seen 50-50, the closest I've probably seen is 60-40. Even then, you can't run a company on 40 percent of your time once you get investment while being on call as a consultant- you still have to answer any patient concerns, any questions, queries.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />  \n            <Blog.Subtitle>IS CLINICAL PRACTICE OVERVALUED IN MEDICINE?</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Quote> \n                <em>\n                    I think in Australia people really value clinical practice. You must be a practicing clinician, otherwise your opinions are considered lower.\n                </em>\n            </Blog.Quote>\n            <Blog.Text>In the United States this is not the case at all; as soon as people see that you have a medical degree, they trust that they have some level of knowledge to bring something to the table. </Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>I've never been asked what specialty I'm doing here, I've never been once asked how much time I spent in hospital here. They just trust that you know what you're doing. So it is a little bit of a different environment. It is a much more enabling environment because you have people who finish their MD and then they simply become a journalist, a public health specialist. They can have the confidence to basically follow whatever it is without: “Oh, maybe I should spend several years going into clinical practice first or 20 percent of my time going into clinical practice.” Although it might not sound like a lot like finding a company - if you need to be spending 20 percent of your year which is several months in the hospital - that is a significant amount of time that you would be spending, perfecting or working on your career otherwise.</Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />  \n            <Blog.Subtitle>MOVING TO THE US: WHERE STATUS IS BASED ON THE PROBLEM YOU WANT TO SOLVE</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text>I'm not sure I knew about the really nuanced cultural differences before coming to the US. Obviously you hear about things like Silicon Valley and there's a lot of support. But once I came here, I realised how intellectually different it was to Australia. There's less tall poppy syndrome- I never have to apologise for achieving a lot. Aussies always cut themselves down- it's just the truth. It's so clear to me when I speak to my friends now, how much they love to depreciate what they do and cut themselves down even though they're achieving a lot, which is a negative thing because you are not clearly showing to others how much you aspire. </Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Text>The other thing is that people here like to always focus on big problems that they want to solve. Obviously there's a bias when it comes to Stanford, where everyone wants to solve problems technologically. I think 66 percent of students here are engineers- so they are always thinking about it from an engineering perspective on how to solve things. </Blog.Text>\n            <Blog.Quote> \n                <em>\n                    Societal status is based on how good the problem is you're solving and how good your solution is, as opposed to something like money or prestige. \n                </em>\n            </Blog.Quote>            \n            <Blog.Text>The medical technology ecosystem is much better. I was saying before, that I can count on my hand probably less than five people who are medical who are also engineers. But here I have met twenty or thirty people who have done it before, who founded successful companies, who are potentially doing clinical practice who simply return to it after their engineering degree. </Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />  \n            <Blog.Subtitle>LIFE MOTTO</Blog.Subtitle>\n            <Blog.Text><em><strong>Pay It Forward:</strong> It describes the concept of helping out and being kind to others without really asking anything in return. </em></Blog.Text>\n            <br />\n            <br />  \n        </Blog.TextBlock>\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\nimport {useParams} from \"react-router-dom\"\nimport { HeaderContainer, FooterContainer, BottomNoteContainer, EmptyHeadContainer} from '../containers';\nimport { Blog } from '../components';\nimport postData from '../data/postData.json';\nimport post_images from '../data/post_image_index'\nimport ReactAudioPlayer from 'react-audio-player';\nimport blogObject from './posts/index'\n\nconst processPostData = postData.map ((post, index) => {\n    let newPost = {...post}\n    newPost.image = post_images[index]\n    return newPost\n})\n\nexport default function BlogPage() {\n    const {blogId} = useParams()\n    const thisPost = processPostData.find(post => post.pagename === blogId)\n    const Body = blogObject[thisPost.filename]\n\n    // Conditional rendering of recording component\n    let audio \n    thisPost.audio === \"\" ? \n    audio = null :\n    audio = <Blog.AudioContainer>\n                <ReactAudioPlayer\n                src={thisPost.audio}\n                autoPlay={false}\n                controls\n                />\n            </Blog.AudioContainer>\n\n    return (\n            <div>\n                <HeaderContainer  />\n                <EmptyHeadContainer />\n\n                <Blog>\n                    <Blog.PostContainer>\n\n                        <Blog.HeaderContainer>\n                            <Blog.PostTitle>{thisPost.name}</Blog.PostTitle>\n                            <Blog.PostSubtitle>{thisPost.title}</Blog.PostSubtitle>\n                            <Blog.PostDate>{thisPost.date}</Blog.PostDate>\n                            <Blog.PostImage src={thisPost.image}/>\n                        </Blog.HeaderContainer>\n                        <Body/>\n                        {audio}\n                        <br/>\n                        <Blog.ReturnLink style={{lineHeight: \"40px\"}}href=\"/\">← Home </Blog.ReturnLink>\n                        <br/>\n                        <Blog.ReturnLink href=\"/blog\">← All Posts </Blog.ReturnLink>\n\n                    </Blog.PostContainer>\n                </Blog>\n\n                <BottomNoteContainer />\n                <FooterContainer />\n            </div>\n\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\nimport { BrowserRouter as Router, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport { Route } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport { Home, Team, Podcast, Covidsations, Blog, BlogPage } from './pages/index';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <Router>\n      <Switch>\n        <Route exact path =\"/team\">\n          < Team />\n        </Route>\n        <Route exact path =\"/podcast\">\n          < Podcast />\n        </Route>\n        <Route exact path =\"/blog\">\n          <Blog />\n        </Route>\n        <Route path =\"/blog/:blogId\">\n          <BlogPage />\n        </Route>\n        <Route exact path =\"/covidsations\">\n          < Covidsations />\n        </Route>\n        <Route exact path =\"/\">\n          < Home />\n        </Route>\n      </Switch>\n    </Router>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.css';\nimport { GlobalStyles } from './global-styles';\nimport App from './App';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <GlobalStyles />\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
