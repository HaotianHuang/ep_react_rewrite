www.eternalpossibilities.com.au re-written in React JS, using create-react-app
<br/>
Initially designed and published in 2018 with Webflow
<br/>
Re-written to be mobile-responsive and load faster (compressed images, and created JSON files to replace Webflow Content Management System)
<br/>
<br/>
Development mode code in main branch
<br/>
<br/>
Deployed to https://kyzooghost.github.io/ep_react_rewrite/#/
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately deployed page currently has UI bug - clicking internal links will not scroll to the top of the new page
Github pages does not natively support React BrowserRouter method, and had to implement HashBrowser instead
