                Professor Harris is a Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery at the University of New South Wales. He's a practicing orthopaedic surgeon with several public and private appointments, who specialises in trauma surgery and lectures both nationally and internationally on the topics of orthopaedics, surgery and epidemiology.
                In addition to sitting on numerous boards, he also leads a prolific research unit specialising in surgical outcomes and the evidence-base for surgery in general. These works formed the basis for both his PhD and his book Surgery:The Ultimate Placebo, in which Prof Harris argues that many common surgeries are performed without robust evidence of their effectiveness.
                He concludes that much of the perceived benefits for many of these procedures could therefore be due to the placebo effect. Both the book and Prof Harris have subsequently garnered much attention.

            <Blog.Subtitle>‍Why do we trust in interventions with poor evidence, even in the age of evidence-based medicine?</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>It's because we are human first and scientists second. To be human is to be faced with two events and naturally want to link them together. So for example if somebody presents to you with back pain, you do an MRI scan and that scan shows something: it could be a dehydrated disc or a small annular tear or whatever, it's a normal human response to associate those two. You see someone in pain and you find something, you immediately think that those two are causally related.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>That's a very human thing to do and that's been built into our logic circuits over evolution, over hundreds of thousands of years. It's a logical shortcut and it actually makes us seem very smart, but sometimes it's wrong. This is the problem. And what happens is people often get better anyway. A lot of people get better from a lot of things.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>In surgery, it's very difficult to convince people otherwise. Using bloodletting as an example, it was only when doctors started looking at the evidence in an objective, scientific way that they found that it actually was not effective. But the physicians who had been using it had seen thousands of patients get better after bloodletting, so you can imagine their reluctance to let that go. That’s the problem: they were being human, they weren't being scientific.</Blog.Text>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <Blog.Subtitle>And sometimes these things take a generation or more to change…</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>I see a lot of young surgeons who have been in practice for only a few years who get it, who really understand how it works and how we have to pay attention to this kind of evidence. They’re also aware of their own biases. Just because a patient got better doesn't mean they got better because of what I did. Would they have gotten better anyway? They can find that out by looking at some of these trials.</Blog.Text>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <Blog.Subtitle>What is the 'Wobbly Triad' and how do we negate its influence in the literature?</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>The Wobbly Triad are three factors that are used to support a lot of surgeries: They’ll find a biologically plausible mechanism, they’ll try it out on some patients and it will seem to work, and they will find laboratory evidence. To me, it's not enough: they do not prove causation. The only way to do that is to divide patients up randomly and do it on some people and don't do it on others. Sounds pretty simple, but that is rarely done.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>The first leg of the triad is a biologically plausible mechanism. Now it’s important to have a biologically plausible mechanism for the treatment that you're proposing. The trouble is if you do have one, it doesn’t necessarily mean that your treatment works. It’s not good enough to just have a biologically plausible mechanism, because you can make up a biologically plausible mechanism for almost anything you want.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>The second leg of the tripod is observational evidence. This is basically saying, “we did it on some people and they seem to get better.” You could do that for the common cold and you'd get 100% success rate, so observational evidence doesn't mean it works.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>And the third one is lab evidence. Lab research is overrated - we look at it as ‘the purest research.’ It’s not. It's all over place. Lab research is really not that good. There's a lot of error in it; there's a lot of small numbers; there's a lot of unreasonable inference going on.</Blog.Text>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <Blog.Subtitle>My practice has changed enormously from what my first 10 years…</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>I used to do a lot of spine fusions, knee scopes and stuff like that because I thought they worked. I don't do them anymore. I stopped doing spine surgery when I started looking at the evidence.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>It wasn't so much the PhD (that prompted this change), it was really the Master's. A lot of people say, "If you do a PhD then you're a good researcher." I would respond that the Masters of Clinical Epidemiology did much more to help my research skills than the PhD. It was the Master’s that taught me the core research skills, and the PhD that allowed me to hone those skills.</Blog.Text>

            <br/>
            <Blog.Subtitle>Why Orthopaedics?</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>I’ve always been interested in science - I was the geeky kid at school who loved physics and maths. Logical puzzles have always been appealing to me. Orthopaedic surgery is full of mechanical problems. My dad was an engineer and best handyman in the world. He could build anything and solve any mechanical problem. I was never nearly as good as him, but that influence led me into orthopaedics.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>And within orthopaedics I was drawn to trauma, because then you're literally putting the jigsaw puzzle back together again, and putting plates and screws and nails in to hold it in place.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>Not many people were doing trauma orthopaedics at that time. It wasn't really attractive because people wanted to do joint replacements, sports medicine, shoulders - these are the glossier specialties - but I just love doing trauma.</Blog.Text>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <Blog.Subtitle>One of my things is trying to make the world a little more scientific</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>In surgery you get into a ‘groove’. I'd come home late at night after operating all day, crash in front of the TV, watch Law and Order, and that was my life. But I always wanted to do more: I wanted to be a better scientist and let that flow into becoming a better surgeon. That led me into clinical epidemiology and research, and then into trying to promote that.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>Nowadays I'm a member of a few societies that promote scientific thought and critical thinking, and try to block the pseudoscience that's out there. A lot of universities capitalise on pseudoscience and have these crazy degrees in things that are stupid, and so we push against that. I think everyone needs to be a bit more scientific - I think it'll make for a better world.</Blog.Text>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <Blog.Subtitle>I toyed with a couple of other specialties when I was a student, like everybody does</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>Back in my junior days I was also interested in anatomical and forensic pathology. But then I did an elective in my final year which really sold me on orthopaedics. I went to Apia, the capital city of Samoa. At the time there were not a lot of specialists there and it was mostly pretty low-level medicine, but there was a French-Vietnamese orthopaedic surgeon from Germany there. I was told, "Well, you can work with this guy if you want?" I said, "Oh yeah, it sounds all right. Yeah, I might do that."</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>This guy was phenomenal. He did amazing things with limited resources. We didn't have an image intensifier in the theatres, so he had to work out ways of fixing things without x-ray, had limited implants and he just taught me absolutely heaps in the few months that I was there. I was just infected by his enthusiasm and knowledge, so I thought, "Oh yeah, I think orthopaedic is for me."</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>Interestingly a lot of junior residents and interns get influenced by the people they work with rather than the specialty itself. If you do a couple of good terms with some orthopaedic surgeons in a unit that's fun, where everyone gets along and they take you under their wing and look after you, that's a very positive reinforcement. You're going to want to do orthopaedics after that.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>I was lucky. My intern year was during The Dispute: between 1984 to 1988 in New South Wales the orthopaedic surgeons weren't operating in the public hospitals. So the orthopaedic registrar had nothing to do and he took me under his wing. We did some closed reductions in the emergency department and stuff like that. He was a very funny guy and he's now a very senior orthopod. I was very influenced by him and other people I'd worked with that made me want to do orthopaedics.</Blog.Text>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <Blog.Subtitle>I'll give you one piece of advice that was given to me when I was an intern…</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>I was working at this hospital as an intern, and at lunchtime you go to the RMOs room where the residents and registrars just hang out and chat. And as I was an intern, people often ask you, "What do you want to do?" I remember saying at the time, "Well, I'm kind of interested in orthopaedic surgery but I'm not sure whether I'll end up doing it." And they asked, "Why not?" I replied, "Because it's too hard to get into. " And they all laughed at me. And they said, "If you want to do something, you'll do it. Don't not do it because it's too hard." And I thought, "Oh, that's interesting."</Blog.Text>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <Blog.Subtitle>Having seen countless people come after me, if you want to do something bad enough you'll do it</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>You'll do what's needed to get in. You'll do the exams, you'll pass them. I know that some people don't get to do what they wanted, but you'd be surprised. By far the majority do.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>So my advice is if you are particularly passionate about one particular area and you want to do it, just go for it and do it. If you're not that keen on it then maybe think about something else because the good thing about medicine is you can do almost anything. There's so much scope for you to travel. I've got a lot of friends that joined the military and other friends who are doctors on cruise ships. Some people I know just do research and don't do any clinical work at all; they really enjoy that. There's all sorts of things you can do, the world is your oyster if you're an intern right now. Just pick what you want to do.</Blog.Text>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <Blog.Subtitle>Don’t sweat the small stuff. Things will work out if you're halfway sensible</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>I had a very fortunate path through life: I got into medicine, got through medicine without any trouble, got all the jobs I wanted to get as an intern and resident, and then got into orthopaedics.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>I didn't get into orthopaedics straight away, I don't want you to think I'm a wunderkind. It took me three attempts to get into the orthopaedic training scheme, which is more than usual: most people get in on the first or second attempt. On my second attempt I was ranked as first reserve, so I'd just missed out. I remember everybody consoling me saying, "Oh too bad. Don't take it too hard. Don't get depressed." And I'm like, "I'm not depressed, I was first reserve, that's really good. That means I should get on next year if I continue to play my cards right." I wasn't worried about it at all.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>The year after I did get on, and I remember the person who was first reserve that time was completely dejected and thought, "Oh my God, my life's over." And I'm like, "What are you on about? You'll get on next year." And he did.</Blog.Text>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <Blog.Subtitle>Another philosophy I've worked out is that nothing is all bad</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>I have had significant setbacks and I remember that feeling in the pit of your stomach which makes you think, "I've screwed up. I've done this wrong." But I've always been able to come out of it on the other side. There's always something you can learn out of it. When these setbacks occur and things don't go your way, you have to think, "There's got to be something I can learn from that. Some good will come from that." It sounds corny, like the saying that ‘every cloud has a silver lining’.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>But that's the way I've done it. You come out at the other end. Being able to see yourself in a few months' time out of it, and knowing that you've done it before and you'll do it again is very helpful. What has really helped me through setbacks is thinking, "Well, that's okay. I've learned from this and I know I'll get out of it. I feel like crap at the moment, but I know that in the near future I won't."</Blog.Text>
