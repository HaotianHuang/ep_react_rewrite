            <Blog.Text>In this feature we interview Nitis (Nine) Rattanagitpaisan, a third year medical student at the Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, Thailand, and learn about the COVID situation in Thailand and its impact on local medical student.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>Can you tell me a bit about the current situation in Thailand? </Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>It’s getting better since the government launched the self-quarantine law in April. The number of new daily cases of COVID has been decreasing from over 100 new cases per day, and now we don’t have any domestic cases. New cases are only imported cases that we are placing in state quarantine. Because of that, the lockdown has been cancelled and stores and restaurants are starting to re-open. However not every business is doing well because the main income of our country is from foreign tourism.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>Can you tell me about how your medical school program is structured, and how COVID has impacted on that?</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>Our program is divided into two phases: a three-year preclinical phase followed by a three-year clinical phase. </Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>Preclinical phase contains mainly lectures and some laboratory work on basic science (cell biology, chemistry and physics), medical principles (immunology, microbiology, pathology and pharmacology) and organ systems (cardiovascular, respiratory, neural system, etc). In these three years preclinical we learn all about the normal human body, anatomy, physiology, diseases and pathologies and some treatments and drugs, and are barely exposed to real patients.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>Effect from COVID on preclinical phase: lecture classes and exams are cancelled, and everything is being done online. Many students found have found that resting and studying in the same place is not very effective. For me, I have fortunately completed my third year by the time the quarantine law was launched but my exam for a national license was postponed until November if COVID gets better. Many of my fellow third year students don’t like this because they just want to get it done and over with.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>Clinical phase is the time we learn to take care of real patients in the hospital. We learn practical skills including how to take a patient’s history, perform a physical examination, diagnose and treat the patients. 4th year contains 4 major blocks - Medicine, surgery, pediatrics and obs and gynae. 5th year contains many minor blocks. 6th year is externship year, we have to be able to treat each patient by ourselves at this point.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>Effect from COVID on clinical phase: The clinical phase is where the biggest effect has been seen. 4th and 5th year classes are shifting to online learning meaning that we lose our opportunity to experience real patients and practice our practical skills. In my opinion, learning cases from just paper is not enough for developing our skills in taking histories (because we have to talk with patients in real life), making diagnoses and treating our patients - all of these are very crucial for a doctor.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>Can you tell me about the typical career pathways for a doctor in Thailand?</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>After completing our six years of medical school, we are called a GP (general practitioner) and we work at public hospitals for a three-year internship. We are required to do this because the government subsides part of our tuition fee and there is a lack of doctors in the public hospitals, or alternatively you can pay 400,000 baht (~AU$20,000) to skip internship. However residencies require you to do the internship, so sometimes it’s not in our interest to pay and get out of the internship. After internship we can apply for three-year residencies in specific fields - pediatrics, surgery, etc. After residency we can apply for two-to-four year fellowships to specialise further, in pediatric cardiology for example.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>Have you noticed any positive changes that come out from the COVID situation? </Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>Of course I’ve seen many positive changes happen because of COVID. People have become accustomed to the general precautions and I think many people are starting to see that things that have high amount of contact, such as doors and water taps, should be automatic especially in hospitals. Students and teachers are getting used to online classes which may be a good way to do lectures in the future. And many people are starting to see how bad our government is.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>Would you like to practice medicine in another country in the future?</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>My friends and I are interested in sitting for the USMLE exam to study residencies abroad in the US, which is pretty popular among Thai medical students.</Blog.Text>
