            <Blog.Subtitle>DECIDING TO DO MEDICINE</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>On the first day of any class in my undergraduate science degree, everyone went around the room and introduced themselves. The tutor would always want to know what you were going to do after science. Everyone would say they wanted to go into medicine after their science degree. I wasn’t really sure, and so I just copied every else’s answer! It wasn’t until I completed my honors research year based in a lab that I decided to go into medicine. Although I could envision myself working in a lab for the rest of my career, I didn’t think it would expand my capabilities, so I decided to challenge myself and go do medicine.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>RURAL GENERALISM</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>‍I was based in metropolitan Melbourne hospitals for my medical degree. It wasn’t until I was a junior doctor that I was exposed to rural medicine. I rotated to Swan Hill as an intern and completed a rotation there in the emergency department. I was so amazed at the skills of the emergency doctors running the department. They weren’t trained emergency specialists; they were rural generalists. That meant that they could do a little bit of everything: primary care, emergency, anesthetics, obstetrics. I thought it was so cool that you could do all these things in one job.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>During my rotation in Swan Hill, I met one particular rural generalist who used to come into the emergency department and play the ukulele. He learned the ukulele when he had spent time on Thursday Island. I was enthralled by his experiences in this place called the Torres Strait. It was then that I decided to move to Cairns, so I could undertake a rotation on Thursday Island as the emergency department resident. It’s a very small emergency department with only two resuscitation bays and another three rooms. I absolutely loved the rotation and everything that this place had to offer. </Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>TRAINING WITH ACRRM</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>When training with the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine (ACRRM), you develop a broad range of skills including primary care, emergency care, pediatrics, obstetrics, and anesthetics. ACRRM also enables you to develop a specialist skill, for me this is in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health, which really fits with the work that I do up here in the Torres Strait. There is so much variety in the training program and plenty of flexibility in jobs after you obtain fellowship. I think that’s what attracted me most to the program.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>CONTINUITY OF CARE</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>Something that you don’t often have the opportunity to experience in hospital medicine as a medical student or junior doctor is the concept of continuity of care. Primary care offers the opportunity to care for patients, their families and communities over a long period of time. Being able to care for patients when they are admitted to hospital and then see them again once they have recovered and are back in the community is deeply rewarding.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>WORKING ON THURSDAY ISLAND</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>There are fifteen doctors who live and work across the Torres Strait. Most of us are based on Thursday Island, and we provide outreach clinics to all the outer islands. There are fifteen different other islands each with their own primary health care centre run by 1-2 rural area nurses and 1-2 health workers. These communities often will only see a doctor once a week or once a fortnight. I think the most valuable life lesson I’ve learned living in the Torres is the value of community. Western culture promotes individualism, whereas community is a core value within the Torres Strait Islander culture. Here everyone works together for the collective good of the community. It certainly is special to be included in this community and culture. </Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>CLIMATE CHANGE</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>I believe our government should focus more on climate change than they have to date. Our lack of governmental policy, reliance on fossil fuels and escalating carbon emissions reinforce our inadequate climate change strategy . Of course, everything in life has been put on hold with the current pandemic. I really hope that after COVID19, we can look at a more sustainable future with renewable energy sources, because it’s communities such as those in the Torres Straits that are affected first. We are already seeing changes in sea life patterns. We are already seeing the impacts of rising sea levels. We are already seeing the health implications that climate change is having on the community.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>CORONAVIRUS</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>As of March 2020 the Torres and Cape Hospital has not had any cases, but we can’t rest on our laurels. We still need to practice hand hygiene, social distancing and stay at home when unwell. I’d encourage all patients to continue to visit their general practitioners to ensure their health checks are up to date.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>Many important primary health programs in the Torres and Cape have reduced capacity as staff have been redeployed to help in the COVID-19 pandemic. These include diabetes educators, allied health, mental health workers and most importantly our Indigenous health workers. They all run programs on different islands to promote healthy lifestyles and help support our communities’ chronic diseases. As a result of this pandemic, we’ve had to significantly limit travel between the islands, and many of these primary care services have limited capacity for the time being. Of course, that’s for the safety of the community and we anticipate that these services will recommence in the near future. </Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>ADVICE FOR MEDICAL STUDENTS</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>Don’t worry about knowing what you want to do by the time you finish medical school. I feel like there were a frenzy of medical students when I finished that were all focused on quickly obtaining a specialty training spot. You don’t need to rush. It is so important as a junior doctor to have a wide variety of clinical experiences and rotations, even if you then go on to become a sub-specialist. Keep an open mind, because you never know, you might find a specialty that you would have never really expected! </Blog.Text>
