            <Blog.Subtitle>A CAREER IN MEDICINE</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>Growing up, my Dad had a really severe lung condition and he regularly travelled from Bendigo to Melbourne to see his specialist. I always found that to be quite unfair. At University, it became more apparent to me that this was also the experience of many regional families. This was one of my core drives to study medicine, as well as to get involved in advocacy efforts. I still think that it is fundamentally wrong that patients who live outside of capital cities have on top of the burden of their illnesses, a burden of travel.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>FINDING YOUR PEOPLE</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>I really enjoyed medical school in general, but there were parts of it that were very isolating. For example, I did my MD2 year in Bendigo which is my hometown, but then for MD3 I returned to the city. There wasn’t much acknowledgement or discussion about how difficult a transition it can be for somebody to change clinical schools halfway through their degree, or to integrate into a different hospital network where they might not know anyone.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>I ended up getting involved with the Outlook Rural Health Club, which provided a lot of support to me in some of those difficult times, and then later I became involved in AMSA and co-founded AMSA Rural Health. Through pursuing my interests in rural health I was able to find people who shared my interests. What I love most about medicine is the people that I've been able to connect with: people who have the same desire to do better for our rural patients and communities.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>CO-FOUNDING THE AMSA RURAL HEALTH CLUB</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>It's important to acknowledge that I co-founded it with Dr Sophie Alpen, who is currently working in the Northern Territory. We were just two people who independently believed that there needed to be more focus on rural health within the medical student agenda, and more opportunity for rural students to contribute to that dialogue. At the time, AMSA was having a lot of conversations about rural health that didn't necessarily involve the voices of rural background students or rural clinical school students.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>A second reason for forming AMSA Rural Health was that while there were other rural health student groups - many of which Sophie and myself had personally been involved with - those groups often received government funding and were therefore often, formally or informally, aligned with current government policy. We both felt that there were many government initiatives in rural health that could have been done differently or better, and that there needed to be a channel where students could freely express their opinions on behalf of themselves and their communities.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO GOOD FOR PEOPLE – A CAREER IN PSYCHIATRY</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>I never planned it. I realised towards the end of medical school that one of the rotations I enjoyed most had been psychiatry. I didn’t ever feel like I had to drag myself out of bed to come in, and I didn’t ever feel like leaving early. In fact, I often stayed late on the rotation. I didn’t realise it at the time, but that was a sign that psychiatry really clicked for me.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>What I enjoy most about psychiatry is the opportunity to help transform our patient’s lives for the better. We're frequently working with some of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged people in our society. Our patients are highly stigmatised by society and also within the medical profession. Their access to healthcare is often poor, and certainly in my opinion unacceptable. The potential to advocate for those patients and to help them navigate the health system for better clinical, psychological and social outcomes is huge.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>Over the past six months I've been working with Victorian Aboriginal communities and out of all the work I’ve done so far in psychiatry, I’ve enjoyed this the most. I have come to really appreciate is the beauty, the strength and the resilience of Aboriginal culture, and the role of culture in the recovery journey.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>MED-ED</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>I really enjoy teaching medical students. It's something I started doing formally about 6 months ago. Medical students are so enthusiastic and I think that's one thing that we can sometimes lose as doctors - that unbridled enthusiasm for just being here. Being around students reminds me of how privileged I actually am to be doing this job and how important our work is as clinicians.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>#DESTINATIONRURAL</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>Over the past few years there has been a really important and necessary focus on rural generalist training, particularly as the National Rural Generalist Pathway begins to take shape. It's my view though, that we need to reform non-GP specialist training in rural areas as well. For example, I'm extremely passionate about rural health but currently training in the city and there are a lot of other specialty registrars who find themselves in similar positions.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>Myself and colleague Dr Louise Manning, who is a GP and Obstetrics registrar working in Bendigo, actually ran a national survey looking at this issue and we were overwhelmed by feedback from junior doctors interested in rural health. We were able to demonstrate that, despite substantial opportunity to participate in rural health as a medical student, the majority of junior doctors don’t receive any information about rural health careers once they graduate.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>Through the Rural Doctors Association of Australia we have been able to build on this work, and recently received federal funding to start a grassroots campaign, called #destinationrural. It is slowly building momentum and we hope that #destinationrural will promote rural health opportunities, but then also act as a networking platform to connect junior doctors who have an interest in rural health.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>MAINTAINING BALANCE WHILST BEING A YES PERSON</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>I think it can be really hard if you're a yes person – I myself am quite a yes person. Part of that probably stems from the fact that I'm so motivated to do good for people with the opportunities that I have. But of course you can't do good for anyone if you're unwell yourself or if you're not taking care of yourself.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>Another part of it is accepting that there will always be more opportunities. I think that sometimes, part of the reason why we take on too much is because we're afraid that if we don't do it now, then we'll never get the opportunity to do it again. It’s hard to change that mindset but we have to realise that our skills and our potential will never go away.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>GIVE UP YOUR SEAT AT THE TABLE</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>The other thing that is important is making sure that every time we get a seat at the table, we ensure that the next seat at that table is for someone who was underrepresented before we got there. Sometimes, we also have to step back and allow other people to take our seats. For example, women, LGBTQI+, Indigenous people - whichever group of people is not well represented. Sometimes the best thing that we can do for our patients is to actually step aside and allow someone to sit in our place.</Blog.Text>
