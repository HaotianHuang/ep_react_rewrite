            <Blog.Subtitle>üîé ‚ÄúI had to find out how to look after my patients properly.‚Äù</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>When I left medical school, I really enjoyed working with children and I thought I was going to be a pediatrician. I did two years of pediatric training and then got interested in child psychiatry. I decided to take a year off to reassess what I wanted to do - that's when I decided to go into general practice, despite initially thinking that I was not going to do general practice! I worked at a clinic in the outskirts of Melbourne, where I saw lots of children. Over that time I had my family: I had a set of twins and another baby 13 months later. The dual commitment of work and family was really busy and hectic!</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>I continued in general practice including owning my own practice until my children were about 14. I wanted another challenge so I decided to go back to uni and study. I did a Master's of Women's Health and a PhD in sexual violence - this was really because of the patients I was seeing. I was seeing a lot of young mums who had issues with breastfeeding and early parenting that were linked with violence in their own early childhood. They did not know how to touch and hold and handle their own children and had fears around that.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>I found that because nobody seemed to ask that question of why this was happening, I ended up doing the research myself so that I could answer my patients' questions. My career path was very much driven by the people I was seeing and feeling that my education was inadequate to serve them. I had to find out how to look after my patients properly.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>üí¨  Take the initiative and ask about family violence</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>From my experiences in the clinic, mothers want to be asked about it (previous family violence). They're often quite ashamed and guilty about what happened in their past. So it's very hard for them to say to you as their health practitioner: ‚ÄúLook, I was sexually abused as a child.‚Äù It's just too difficult for them. But if you take the initiative and ask, they are often quite relieved.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>You don‚Äôt have to start with a confronting question. It doesn't have to be: ‚Äúwere you raped as a child?‚Äù It can be something like ‚Äúwere you ever frightened as a child?‚Äù or ‚Äúdid anyone ever make you feel uncomfortable when you were little?‚Äù</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>As soon as you do that it's like the floodgates are opening. Or you'll see their faces shut off and they don't want to talk about it.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>‚è±Ô∏è ‚ÄúThe opportunity to see the healing that happens over time‚Äù</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>I can still remember asking one of the new patients in my clinic who was in her forties and had a long history of psychiatric illness, ‚ÄúHave you ever been afraid?‚Äù She said, ‚ÄúLook, nothing, nothing has ever happened to me. I don't want to talk about it.‚Äù</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>Around 12 months later she walked into my clinic and she told me, ‚ÄúYou know that question you asked me 12 months ago? I'm ready to talk to you today.‚Äù Then she told me this story about having been abused by a stepfather. The important thing for practitioners is to not to feel like a failure when people can't open up or tell you straight away. It's often a very painful memory. When they are ready and if you give them permission to, they‚Äôll take about it</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>The lovely thing about general practice is that since you have ongoing care of a patient, you get the opportunity to see the healing that happens over time.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>Another patient, a young woman who couldn't breastfeed her baby as she used to get frightened by her baby‚Äôs smile, had been abused as a little girl by a male relative. The baby‚Äôs smile triggered her and made her fearful. It was nice being her GP and watching her learn over time that her baby‚Äôs smile wasn‚Äôt the same as her abuser‚Äôs smile. Over 14 years of practice I saw her relationship with her son develop into what I'd call a normal mum-adolescent relationship without that fear that crippled her when she had her little baby. It wasn't just me - she was involved with therapists and psychiatrists who were prepared to deal with the effects of family violence. She made a really great recovery and had a good relationship with her son and I got to see that. That's something special about being a general practitioner.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>It‚Äôs really important to recognise violence in women's lives early. There's a possibility that we can make a difference and change the future for them and their children.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>‚ùî"A lot of students think it's a social problem, it's not medical, so why should we bother?‚Äù</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>Family violence is a socially constructed thing, but it has a significant impact on mental health and physical health. For example there are chronic pain syndromes that follow various forms of family violence, depression and anxiety, that don‚Äôt get better if you just treat them as depression and anxiety. If you don‚Äôt identify the cause there is no point putting someone through various forms of therapy of anxiety. If she's still getting beaten at home, it's not going to get better. You're going to get frustrated about treating her unless you know the cause. You've got to know the cause to make a difference.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>üéâ Creating PACTS: An innovative award-winning Primary care Program Advancing Competency To Support family violence survivors</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>I'd been in discussions with people at Monash University about how difficult it was to teach about family violence no one stepped up to be a champion. If there wasn't a member of staff who was prepared to teach about it, then it tended not to be taught. A lot of practitioners feel quite uncomfortable teaching about family violence when they don't know a lot about it or haven't experienced managing it.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>There's a whole group of practitioners that are first responders to family violence, who see it all the time. So we decided as a group of interprofessionals that we would work together and create a teaching package that we could all use.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>It was quite difficult to create a manual around how to teach it and how to respond to the students' questions. Male students often feel quite threatened. So it is very important to teach it in an inclusive way. Men are part of the solution as well as part of the problem; women can be part of the problem too.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>We included cases for paramedics units which is quite different to what we might see in a clinic in general practice, which is also different to what a social worker might see in a hospital. So we created stories that actually resonated with the different professions and spent quite a lot of time talking to patients. We also involved the Domestic Violence Resource Centre and patient advocates from the community. It was important to have patient voices.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>üåê From patients in the clinic to going across the world - mind blowing!</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>We were really pleased with what we created in the end. It won the Dean's Award for Teaching Excellence and also the University Award for Teaching Excellence. That was pretty exciting. The World Health Organisation used some of our videos in their education as another way of teaching family violence in resource poor countries.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>It's mind blowing, when you think of yourself as a GP in a clinic seeing the same patients every day, to then taking an issue that those patients faced and creating some knowledge and teaching resources around it, and then have it go to the World Health Organisation! You don't think that your work will ever end up like that. Yet in some ways it's those little girl dreams that you go into medicine for to make a difference, and then when that happens you go ‚ÄúOh wow‚Äù.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>üîÆ The future of family violence - We still need to be active and be agents for change.</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>The problem is not going to go away quickly. It is multifaceted and there are all sorts of factors behind why it happens. I think certainly the work in prevention is really important. This is what the Give Respect project is all about ‚Äì promoting respectful behaviours amongst university students as a way to prevent violence.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>While the focus will be on prevention, as clinicians we are still going to be dealing with the effects. We will need to know what to do in clinical practice, whether we are surgeons or rheumatologists dealing with chronic pain, or psychiatrists. There's still more work that needs to be done on best practice responses and how to best work with patients and at the community level.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>As general practitioners, we all know that prevention is the most important thing in general practice work.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>One of the evolving concepts within the family violence realm is better understanding diversity across cultures and disability. We know that we are not very well informed in how to respond to culturally appropriate ways. Diversity and inclusion needs to be handled better.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>üè• Why all doctors need to be aware of these issues.</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>In patients where nothing seems to be working, you have to really think to yourself, ‚Äúis there something else going on?‚Äù In general practice we call it a red flag. Although it may not be a physical condition, there may be a serious social condition underlying why these patients are here all the time. Even if you don't know what to do, you don't have to do anything as long as you ask that gentle question in a caring way and then refer the patient appropriately. You're not responsible for the treatment in that case. But as I have said early on, it's about opening the door.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>üìö Research and Medical Education- ‚Äúit gave me the space where I could think and be more creative than in clinical medicine.‚Äù</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>I love my clinical work. I really enjoy seeing patients, but I must say that teaching students is just as much fun. There are similar challenges: trying to get people interested in learning, when they sometimes really didn't want to. It's a bit like trying to get a patient to take therapy when they don't really want to.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>Research was really important to me in that it gave me a space where I could think and be more creative than in clinical medicine. I suppose the creative part has always been really important to me. I felt that my creative side was neglected in clinical medicine. The transition across wasn't difficult - I was ready for a new challenge!</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>üí° Advice for medical students and junior doctors: ‚ÄúDon't be afraid to take something you find at the coalface that you can't find an answer for.‚Äù</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>My advice would be, for anything you're interested in and think is important - don‚Äôt just follow your heart, but be passionate about it. Even when people say to you, as my head of department said to me when I was starting my PhD: ‚ÄúOh, please, would you do medical workforce? It's so much more important than sexual violence.‚Äù I just looked at him and said, ‚ÄúI can't, because my patients don't talk about medical workforce but they do talk about sexual violence.‚Äù So just to be prepared to have your beliefs challenged and for people to say to you that you are doing the wrong thing.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>I knew my patients thought it was really important, so I was prepared to fight for it because it's what I was seeing at the coalface. I think people will challenge you in areas like this. They will say to you that it's the wrong work to be doing. But I've never been afraid of not having the same path as my colleagues. I would tell students and young doctors, if there's something that you feel is really important, don't be afraid if the medical establishment doesn't think the same. Go for it. Just go for it and make a difference to the people you see.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>Don't be afraid to take something you find at the coalface that you can't find an answer for. Don't be afraid to take that forward and be prepared to learn new things and create new knowledge.</Blog.Text>
