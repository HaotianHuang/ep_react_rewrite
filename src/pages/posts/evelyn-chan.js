            <Blog.Author>DISCOVERING THE THERAPEUTIC POWER OF VIRTUAL REALITY</Blog.Author>
            <Blog.Text>The first time I really encountered virtual reality was through a colleague at BCG. He told me a very personal story about how his grandmother had dementia, and how he went back to her hometown in Italy, did a tour of her house and the neighborhood with a basic GoPro 360, switched the recording into a 3D format and popped a VR headset onto her head. His grandma was able to spark precious memories such as old Italian dances.Her mood lifted and she became much more sociable. These were powerful effects that he had been able to evoke through VR, which hadn’t been triggered from 2D video or photos.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>This really got me thinking about how we can use virtual reality, particularly at a time where VR is much more accessible and affordable through advanced mobile phone technology. We found some interesting evidence in the burns literature suggesting that using virtual reality during burns could decrease pain, even to the extent of potentially reducing opioid medication doses. The Gate Control theory of Pain suggests that if you immerse a patient into a virtual environment and engage all their senses, it would powerfully reduce their ability to register pain. This got me thinking – how can we apply this to everyday medicine now that VR is becoming a lot easier to use?</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>My co-founder Paul, is an adult respiratory physician. He was asking me “What do you do to all your patients? They come to me as they’re transitioning into adulthood (especially patients with cystic fibrosis) and some of them are so needle phobic that I have to book in general anesthetic to change their IV drip every three days.” We put two and two together, and figured – why don’t we improve these basic medical procedures that we take for granted and we think are really simple, but our patients are really scared of them. We know that early traumatic experiences can establish needle phobia and healthcare avoidance for life.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>Working in pediatrics I have poked a lot of kids. I felt guilty when I missed, and for pediatric residents it’s one of the biggest causes of stress in their work – guilt around hurting patients while doing necessary tests. On the otherhand, we see some doctors do a fantastic job managing patients and I wondered about how we could scale their approach so that every patient has the same opportunity to receive high-quality care for procedural pain management.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>That’s how we started using virtual reality and testing it to improve our own medical practice.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Author>PURSUING PEDIATRICS</Blog.Author>
            <Blog.Text>I think the first thousand days of life is really the most important time in your life. It’s a time of tremendous potential, but also enormous vulnerability. It really sets that foundation for health outcomes long-term. I was always really fascinated by the rapid development and change and learning that happens from infancy through childhood into adolescence. I felt that if you could make a positive difference early on and get the child onto a positive health trajectory, that could impact the child and also the family and community significantly.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Author>THE HUMAN RESOURCES CHALLENGE IN START-UPS</Blog.Author>
            <Blog.Text>I think a lot of the challenges in driving a startup can be anticipated. We knew it was going to be difficult to bring an idea into reality and then into a commercial arena. The good thing about medicine is that you develop that skillset of assessing a situation comprehensively, and then making a diagnosis and planning how to manage all the things that could go wrong.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>The biggest challenge I deal with on a day-to-day basis is the human resources element: finding the right team that is really great at their job, but also comfortable with ambiguity and risk and a constantly evolving job description. Often it comes from a mindset of wanting to learn and grow and expand, and becoming comfortable with being outside your comfort zone. It’s key to have the right judgement to know: when can I do something safely? When should I get an expert in to help?</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Author>GROWING INTO A GENTLE AND QUIET, YET EFFECTIVE LEADER</Blog.Author>
            <Blog.Text>One of my teachers from high school – Rosemary Barkley – was incredibly passionate as a history teacher. She really brought Revolutions (a senior secondary history subject) to life. She also led the social service program, which I was really involved in. I definitely wasn’t the smartest student or the best students, and I didn’t have a lot of confidence in myself. She was one of the first people who really believed in me and backed me as a person. She taught me that you could be a gentle and quiet leader, yet still very effective.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>Dr Cathy Crock, a paediatric haematologist and Founder of The Hush Foundation, is also such an inspiration to me.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>I think quiet leaders often reflect a lot and improve quickly to external feedback as well as their own – they are their own harshest critics. I think through listening, you can really understand what people are thinking and what their needs are, and therefore how to improve a team or culture. That is ultimately what leadership boils down to: Being able to get everyone aligned and believing in the same cause, and wanting to do their best to contribute to it.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>Often it comes down to putting yourself out there and being outside your comfort zone, even when it’s not easy. I think over time people put their trust in you and you grow into that role. I’ve seen lots of people make amazing progress.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Author>BE KIND TO YOURSELF AND TO OTHERS</Blog.Author>
            <Blog.Text>Be kind to yourself. Medical people are usually type A personalities. I think we’re all doing our best, but there’s so much outside our control</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>Second be kind to others. Lifelong friendships are formed during the hard times and the best friendships are formed when you’re willing to go the extra mile to help others out.</Blog.Text>
