            <Blog.Text>Medicine is my lawful wife and literature my mistress; when I get tired of one, I spend the night with the other, to the detriment of neither.‚Äù -Anton Chekhov (Russian physician-writer)</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>MAKING THE SPACE IN LIFE FOR WRITING ‚úçüèæ</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>I‚Äôve always kept a journal. Growing up in an age where TV and screens were not ubiquitous like they are now, I spent a lot of childhood scribbling, writing and reading. When I entered medical school I decided to continue my writing hobby, but I thought I would have to drop it eventually because I was becoming busier and busier. I found though, that the busier I got the more writing helped me centre myself and make sense of all the things I was experiencing as a medical student. So I continued to write.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>When I was younger I used to think that one day I would have some amazing place on the beach, or a shack in the mountains, where I would look out the window and inspiration would pour through, helping me write. The sad reality is that the place I write most often is in my car when I‚Äôm waiting for the kids to finish some sport or the other. Or I write in my bedroom, propping myself on some pillows.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>What I have figured out is that there is never a perfect time or place to write. If you are going to get work done, you have to be opportunistic.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>COMPASSION IN MEDICINE IS NOT AN OPTIONAL EXTRA üêº</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>In becoming a doctor, you are entering a profession that is full of high-achieving, competitive and ambitious people. That‚Äôs not a bad thing. If you look at all the bold progress that has been made in medicine, it has been made by people who have been willing to take a chance and be daring and perhaps arrogant to believe in their dreams.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>I think it‚Äôs important to produce competent doctors, but it‚Äôs also incredibly important to produce good human beings. One of the things that I really want to emphasise to all the trainees I come in contact with is that it‚Äôs possible to be a good, compassionate, empathetic doctor as well as a smart and proficient doctor. Those things are not mutually exclusive.</Blog.Text>
