            <Blog.Text><i>Dr Jefferson Tang is currently a doctor at Austin Health. Fittingly, as the founder of Eternal Possibilities, he has had a rich set of career experiences from working as a top rated car salesman to a blockchain analyst at an early-stage venture firm. I sat down with him to learn about the lessons he’s gained through his experiences.</i></Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>WHY DID YOU START ETERNAL POSSIBILITIES</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>I studied biomedicine at Melbourne before starting medical school, and because of the Melbourne model we were required to take a breadth subject each semester (i.e. an elective subject from outside our department). I really enjoyed this choice because it gave me range and diversity to the material I was learning, and I loved taking maths and computer science subjects outside of biomedicine. In contrast, I remembered going through my first week of medical school, realising we had no electives and sitting through what must’ve been eight hour long lecture marathons, then asking myself whether I was ever going to get a chance to give my attention to something outside of medicine.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>Perhaps it was because I had been a student for too long, but it seemed our cohort was encouraged to make becoming future doctors the principal part of our identity and focused attention. Though for some peers this mindset certainly resonated, I craved more variety in impact for my professional life. For me, hackathons and hobby projects helped bounce me back from lectures and flashcards, whilst also piquing my interest in commerce. So when a friend asked if I wanted to work as partners in his new business, I decided to take a gap year off to commit to this venture with excitement and eagerness. Coming from medicine, however, presented itself with unique challenges. It seemed the culture of precise academic language I was so accustomed to hearing and speaking often fell flat in business where words are expected not only to describe reality as is but to project at what success could change reality to be. I left after a few months deciding I wanted a more traditional avenue into business, so I took a sales job at a car dealership. Each customer there was an opportunity not only to practise my skills but also to gain experience connecting with people from all walks of life. The start of any good conversation with a potential customer is to step into their shoes and connect with them on something which matters to them. As I got better at this I began to broaden my worldview and understanding of people, which is an opportunity which can be hard to come by during school.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>No doubt, these adventures outside of medicine have helped shape me to become a better doctor as well as sharpened my excitement for what I want my future to look like. Many times the same can be said with other doctors I’ve spoken to who have ventured outside of medicine and explore their interests. Rather than detract or distract, the learnings and skills from these experiences can synergise with medicine in unexpected ways. Ultimately, it is this perspective I wanted to share with the world, which led me to start Eternal Possibilities.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>ADVICE FOR MEDICAL STUDENTS</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>If you’re a medical student curious about something outside of medicine, I’d encourage you to take your passions seriously. I wouldn’t say there is a specific list of steps I’d recommend, but it’s more about the process of jumping into an area you’re interested in and seeing where it takes you.</Blog.Text>
