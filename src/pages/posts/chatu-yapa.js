            <Blog.Subtitle>JOINING MSF TWO-AND-A-HALF YEARS OUT OF MEDICAL SCHOOL üéì</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>I had wanted to be a doctor in Africa since I was about nine years old. I just always knew. I had since always thought about ways in which I could go work in Africa. I don‚Äôt know why Africa, but that‚Äôs just where I wanted to work. When I was in medical school I heard about MSF and that they work in areas that no one else goes to.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>FIRST SIX-MONTH MISSION: SOUTH SUDAN, 2012 üá∏üá∏</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>I was so excited going in, and I didn‚Äôt really know what to expect. It was when I was landing in the four seater plane on this dirt airstrip in this remote village on the border between Sudan and South Sudan that I realised - wow this is getting real! Coming up to the hospital with the MSF gates, I remember thinking - this is where I‚Äôm going to be for the next six months.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>The excitement wore away after the first month to be replaced by the struggles of the daily grind. I was one of the only doctors in a 90-bed hospital with adult, pediatric, TB, and malnutrition wards. I was dealing with diseases that I hadn‚Äôt really come across in New Zealand and Australia. It was a really steep learning curve.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>We had a child die almost every day in the first month I was there and that was really heartbreaking. There were many times when I just felt completely out of my depth.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>At the five month point I experienced burnout. I hadn‚Äôt experienced such an extreme environment where I was tested in every possible way - mentally, physically, emotionally. I was just so ready to come home.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>GOING ON TO MSF MISSIONS IN NORTH IRAQ, PHILIPPINES, LIBERIA, LEBANON AND NIGERIA üó∫Ô∏è</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>I went on my second mission to figure out if all missions were this difficult. I found that they weren‚Äôt. Having now been through all the other missions, I can say that the first was the hardest. I kept going back for more because I loved that MSF spirit of humanitarianism and volunteerism.</Blog.Text>
