            <Blog.Author>Interviewed and Written by Jessie Zhou </Blog.Author>
            <Blog.Text>I am incredibly excited to have the opportunity to have a chat with Dr Khoa Cao, a person of many accomplishments and talents. To name a few: he is a medical doctor, health economist, creative entrepreneur, start-up founder, public health expert, and bioengineer- currently studying MS program at Stanford University as a Fulbright Scholar.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>Recently he was the convenor of the prestigious Global Alliance of Medical Excellence (GAME-TEI), an international collaboration of nine medical schools across the world looking at medical artificial intelligence (AI) engineering, ethics and policy and how this can be applied to the design and implementation of a medical AI project.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>HELPING THE LIVES OF THE LESS FORTUNATE</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>I always wanted to be a doctor since I was five. But in fact, what I realised now is that I didn't necessarily want to be a doctor, but I wanted to help the lives of the less fortunate. In my mind, I always thought that being a doctor was the fastest and easiest way to achieve that. The reason for that was my grandpa was a doctor and I grew up with him as a heavy influence. I went through that whole track of wanting to go to med school, eventually getting into med school, but then realising when I was on the wards that I couldn't have as much impact on the disadvantaged populations as I wanted to. Seeing what consultants did, although exciting, wasn't quite the exact same goal that I had since I was young. </Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>So I was a little bit lost in a way because I really liked being on the wards. I really enjoyed speaking to patients, but it wasn't as fulfilling. I'm so happy that I wasn't fulfilled. I think that's a really important difference- so I set out, trying to find experiences that would make me fulfilled and learning more about other people's experiences. </Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>ONE LIFE-CHANGING EMAIL: INTERNING WITH THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>I was really lucky because after my fourth year exams, I basically emailed someone from the World Health Organisation: “Hey, can I tag along for several months? You don't have to pay me or anything. I'm happy to come for free and just help out.”</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>Fortunately, someone said yes- during my time there I learnt a lot in terms of what doctors could do beyond a clinical career and met a lot of doctors who did MedTech. </Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Quote> 
                <em>
                    I was really naive because I even brought my stethoscope on my first day at the World Health Organisation- I didn't realise there was anything else you could do outside of clinical medicine. 
                </em>
            </Blog.Quote>
            <Blog.Text></Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>I came back and realised that I can't go back to the clinical side, because medical technology affords so much more opportunity. You could really help billions of people with a single innovation - as opposed to just one by one in clinical practice. Obviously, you miss out on the whole patient experience and being able to be really involved in someone's life; but you get to benefit large masses of people. That really set me on the path. I've always been interested in engineering and technology as well as public health, so it was a natural shift over. </Blog.Text>                   
            <br />
            <br />  
            <Blog.Subtitle>FROM DOCTOR TO ENGINEER</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>I never thought I'd ever be an engineer. I was always interested in technology, but not as an engineer. Then I met some people who were working in the space with mobile apps. I thought AI was really cool, so during my BMedSci year when I had quite a lot of spare time, I taught myself coding. There are so many accessible materials which made it really easy to learn, even with someone who has never coded before.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>A lot of resources for computer science and now widely available online. For example, Stanford has essentially all their classes online, lectures, notes- it's all freely available online for anyone to access. It requires discipline, doing the exercises, doing the homework, doing the lectures and holding yourself to a high standard when you learn. I think if you really look for it, it's really easy to find. I would just encourage anyone who's interested to just give it a try. It doesn't take too long to start coding and to build something really easy and then start to build your knowledge layer on layer, as you get to more complex things.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>So I just did it and I didn't quite ask anyone if I should have- I think it was just a matter of opportunity.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>CHANGING THE FUTURE OF MALARIA DIAGNOSTICS: HorusAI </Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>It was a massive learning experience. I feel medical students often really like asking for permission to do things, and my natural tendency was not to do that. </Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>With HorusAI, the goal was to essentially solve a big problem in malaria diagnostics. Looking back now, we made a lot of mistakes, we learnt a lot of lessons. But it was only through doing that, that we could learn those lessons. Horus AI was essentially an automated platform to diagnose malaria on blood films. </Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>We found that a bottleneck from a global health space was that there weren't enough malaria diagnosticians- people who could diagnose what strain of malaria it is and quantify the malaria to know how serious the parasitaemia is on thick and thin blood films. </Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>Some countries in sub-Saharan Africa were sending thick and thin blood films to Norway so that it could be read, because they didn't have enough staff. It took three to six months for the sides to return, which from a clinical perspective, was just absolutely crazy. Imagine sending a path test and getting the result back in three to six months. You wouldn't have any ability to treat the malaria properly- you wouldn’t even have an ability to find out if the patient has malaria, or track the spread of malaria. </Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>So we thought, this could be something that could be easily and very rapidly done by computer vision. So, myself, Matt Chan and Emily Yeung, who is another friend of mine (all doctors) founded a company. We started training an algorithm, and then managed to get some small seed funding. Unfortunately, what we didn't recognise was the challenges of implementation in the global health space. It is extremely challenging because you have so many different parties involved, different donors, different governments and different regulatory agencies. </Blog.Text>

                    So you can have the solution, but getting it to scale is extremely difficult. We learned a lot of lessons from that.

            <Blog.Subtitle>COLLABORATION IN MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY: med_hack</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>We looked at the medical technology space in Melbourne and thought, there's not enough collaboration between different parties. Can we create an event that brings together clinicians, engineers, businesses, business specialists (MBAs), designers as well as patients? If we could start to identify important clinical needs in Australia and then find solutions for them. By bringing in together the brains, we can come up with some really great ideas.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>Fortunately, while we were just students at that stage, the universities and hospitals really supported us-  provided funding and expert help. We found that there was a really big appetite in Melbourne for medical technology events, particularly ones that are collaborative. And since then, med_hack has been adopted by a student group at Monash (MYMI) that has managed to grow it into a very large hackathon. But unfortunately, the event has been cancelled this year because of the COVID pandemic. But, it's great to see something that we envisioned grow into something really big later on.</Blog.Text>

            <br />  
            <Blog.Subtitle>THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE IN A MEDTECH CAREER</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>I think the hardest thing has actually been the environment, the resistance and the almost uphill fight. I've had quite a lot of strange looks when I say I have trained as a medical doctor and practiced as a medical doctor, but want to do medical devices with technology. </Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Quote> 
                <em>
                    People always go: “Is that a specialty? Is it not a specialty? What does that actually mean?” 
                </em>
            </Blog.Quote>
            <Blog.Text>So in terms of role models and environment, it's been really difficult. There's very few role models in Australia for medical clinicians who are also engineers. There was actually a cohort or several cohorts, I believe, from Monash, where they polited a program, in the 70s or 80s, where they trained medical doctors as well as engineers- so there were people who graduated as medical doctors who were also trained in engineering. I've actually met one of those graduates from Monash Health who is now working as a cardiologist, but also trained as an electrical engineer. </Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>So I can probably count on the back of my hand how many medical engineers there are. While they do exist,  a network doesn't exist, mentorship doesn't exist, role models don’t exist. With the new generation of medical students, there's a lot of students who are asking what can I do beyond clinical practice? Particularly as specialist training programs are just getting harder to get into- the numbers are so restricted. Even once you finish a training program, it's really hard to get a specialist job these days. So there's a lot of people who are asking, can I use my skills better instead of spending 10 years trying to get into a training program? So I think the biggest challenge I've had to face is culture and role models. But the tide is shifting. We just need more people working in the area and supporting each other.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>From a talent perspective, talent is very hard to find in Australia in terms of medical devices and medical technology. But, I'm finding more and more particularly young doctors who are very open to working in the space because they know the technology can provide significant benefits for patients if used and developed correctly.</Blog.Text>
            <br />
            <br />  
            <Blog.Subtitle>LOOKING TO THE FUTURE: BIOTECH IS THE NEW SOFTWARE</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>Where I see myself ... probably I'll just be running a medical device technology company. There's nothing quite like creating your own company or working for a company whose mission you believe in. That is a really fulfilling experience. </Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>In terms of where the medical device and technology space will be in five to ten years, that's obviously really hard to guess. But medical AI is likely to be much larger, neuro engineering is going to be much larger. So we might start seeing really early stage brain computer interfaces of some level. Then there's also bioengineering- essentially the engineering at a cellular level. There's also some really exciting stuff from the genetic side, from a synthetic biology side. We might start seeing some really interesting treatments that we've never thought of or never seen for diseases like cancer and chronic diseases. It's a really fast growing industry. In Silicon Valley, people have started to recognise that biotech is the new software. So we'll probably see some exciting things that I cannot predict currently.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>LEAVING THE CLINICAL INDUSTRY: MEDICINE IS THE BIGGEST SAFETY NET YOU CAN HAVE</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>It does take a lot of courage to leave the medical and clinical industry once you start clinical practice. I feel like one should at least finish internship so that they get enough clinical experience, because being a doctor is obviously really different from being a medical student on the wards. </Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>But once you do that, it is a leap of faith in terms of switching to a different field where there's a lot more uncertainty in your life. You no longer have a stable job. But one of the best advice I've heard, and this is really lucky because I heard this really early on in my career from Sandro Demaio, he said that: “Medicine is essentially a field where you actually have the biggest safety net you can possibly have.” The reason for that is that your ability to locum means that you can essentially obtain money really fast. No other career has that safety net. No other career allows you to suddenly earn one hundred dollars per hour as soon as you are registered.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>There is so much security if you want to switch to medical technology or medical devices. Because in the case that you fail, you simply earn a hundred dollars an hour the next day. There's no job that has that sort of security. </Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Quote> 
                <em>
                If anything, doctors should be taking more risks for things like public health or medical innovation, because the possibility that you might push the envelope can be quite high, particularly if you already have clinical training.
                </em>
            </Blog.Quote>
            <Blog.Text>So I've always sort of kept that in mind, because a lot of my friends ask “how are you going to earn money?”. Well if I need money, I can just locum right? That is a really great resource for doctors. </Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>You don't have to make that leap of faith suddenly. It's so much easier if you start building a foundation in terms of advising for medical technology companies, seeing if it's the right field for you, starting to develop skills in that field. I think I see a lot of doctors assume that because they do clinical practice, they can suddenly switch over to medical technology and suddenly have the skills that people have built up over years or decades of practice- this is not the case. You need to start building up those skills early. You look at different sides of the problem when you are in clinical practice versus when you are a technologist or an engineer. So, you really have got to build it up and at some point take the leap of faith, knowing that you will have a safety net in the case things do fail.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>HOW TO BALANCE MEDTECH AND A CLINICAL CAREER IN MEDICINE?</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>I wish I could say that you could do 50-50, but I've never seen anyone do it. A lot of the people I've spoken to and from what I see, do a 90-10 split at most, or maybe even 80-20, if you're lucky. So you have to decide whether you want 80 percent in clinical practice and the other 20 percent advising companies, founding companies but not doing anything afterwards or managing small time projects. Or if you want 80 percent to be on the medical technology side, you can actually get to do proper engineering, found and build companies and solve actual medical technology problems; then 20 percent you locum every now and practice a little bit. Unfortunately I haven't ever seen 50-50, the closest I've probably seen is 60-40. Even then, you can't run a company on 40 percent of your time once you get investment while being on call as a consultant- you still have to answer any patient concerns, any questions, queries.</Blog.Text>

            <br />  
            <Blog.Subtitle>IS CLINICAL PRACTICE OVERVALUED IN MEDICINE?</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Quote> 
                <em>
                    I think in Australia people really value clinical practice. You must be a practicing clinician, otherwise your opinions are considered lower.
                </em>
            </Blog.Quote>
            <Blog.Text>In the United States this is not the case at all; as soon as people see that you have a medical degree, they trust that they have some level of knowledge to bring something to the table. </Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>I've never been asked what specialty I'm doing here, I've never been once asked how much time I spent in hospital here. They just trust that you know what you're doing. So it is a little bit of a different environment. It is a much more enabling environment because you have people who finish their MD and then they simply become a journalist, a public health specialist. They can have the confidence to basically follow whatever it is without: “Oh, maybe I should spend several years going into clinical practice first or 20 percent of my time going into clinical practice.” Although it might not sound like a lot like finding a company - if you need to be spending 20 percent of your year which is several months in the hospital - that is a significant amount of time that you would be spending, perfecting or working on your career otherwise.</Blog.Text>
            <br />
            <br />  
            <Blog.Subtitle>MOVING TO THE US: WHERE STATUS IS BASED ON THE PROBLEM YOU WANT TO SOLVE</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>I'm not sure I knew about the really nuanced cultural differences before coming to the US. Obviously you hear about things like Silicon Valley and there's a lot of support. But once I came here, I realised how intellectually different it was to Australia. There's less tall poppy syndrome- I never have to apologise for achieving a lot. Aussies always cut themselves down- it's just the truth. It's so clear to me when I speak to my friends now, how much they love to depreciate what they do and cut themselves down even though they're achieving a lot, which is a negative thing because you are not clearly showing to others how much you aspire. </Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>The other thing is that people here like to always focus on big problems that they want to solve. Obviously there's a bias when it comes to Stanford, where everyone wants to solve problems technologically. I think 66 percent of students here are engineers- so they are always thinking about it from an engineering perspective on how to solve things. </Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Quote>

            </Blog.Quote>            
            <Blog.Text>The medical technology ecosystem is much better. I was saying before, that I can count on my hand probably less than five people who are medical who are also engineers. But here I have met twenty or thirty people who have done it before, who founded successful companies, who are potentially doing clinical practice who simply return to it after their engineering degree. </Blog.Text>
