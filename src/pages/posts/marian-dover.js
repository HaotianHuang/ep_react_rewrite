            <Blog.Text>Dr Marian Dover is a rural generalist GP, training in obstetrics in rural New South Wales. A well-known rural health advocate, Marian is passionate about doctor wellbeing, climate change and advocating for rural generalist training. Dr Dover is a board member of the Rural Doctors Association of Australia (RDAA), representing doctors in training. She is a shining example of the future of rural generalism in Australia and in this interview with her, we discuss a variety of topics from her early years in Egypt to the impact of coronavirus on her small Australian country town.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>WHY A CAREER IN MEDICINE?</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>I grew up in Egypt, which sounds super cool, but people forget it’s a third world country. There’s lots of health issues and poverty there. As a kid, I always wanted to do something that was meaningful, something that would change a community, or change people’s outlook on life. I believe the poverty that you see in a third world country really shapes the kind of person that you become. When we came to Australia, my Dad got unwell and was diagnosed with cancer during my HSC. I saw some really great doctors who were super helpful with Dads’ journey. I also saw some not so great clinicians. I remember when he was diagnosed, the doctor was so blunt and brief with us. I remember walking out and just feeling, I think I probably would have done a better job breaking that news. From there, it became passion, that I would end up being a doctor, and help people in a similar situation. We get used to seeing people who are unwell and it becomes a day to day norm. I think if you ground yourself and remember that this could be the worst day of somebody’s life, you won’t lose your humanity.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>RURAL EXPERIENCE</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>I actively sought opportunities to gain rural medical experience. I just started contacting the rural doctors network and the workforce agencies to ask them if they wouldn’t mind having a medical student tag along to outreach clinics and things like that. I littered all of my medical school holidays with rural clinical things. I know that it’s really hard to get rural placements and they are getting increasingly popular. I always tell people, there are opportunities. You might have to self-fund some of the time, but it’s so worth it. I was doing clinical things before some of my colleagues had even stepped into a hospital.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>FINDING MOTIVATION</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>I remember, as a young, naive medical student, I had this thought that I just wanted to be a doctor that was really useful. If a friend was to become unconscious at a party, which doctor would you want? Would you want the ophthalmologist or the paediatric neurologist? Would you want an emergency physician or someone with intubating skills and things like that? I was, like look, honestly, I just want to be useful. I want to be good at lots of things so that I can help a community. I think that’s what motivates me most about my job. That no matter what a patient walks in with, in the vast majority of cases, I can get them feeling better when they walk out.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>A RURAL GENERALIST CAREER</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>I always wanted to be a non GP specialist because general practice seemed way too hard. I thought there was no way I was going to be good at everything the way that GPs are. However, in my final year of medical school I was in Lithgow, which is just past the Blue Mountains in New South Wales. In Lithgow, there are three or four rural generalists, who do a bit of emergency, a bit of anaesthetics, a bit of obstetrics. I was so amazed by the diversity of their work and what they could accomplish. The town itself has a population of 9,000 people and everyone was so grateful when these doctors were around. That just clicked for me - I realised I wanted to be useful to a community. I also wanted that work life balance where you’ve got a house not far from the hospital and you have a decent sized place for your kids to run around. Until you see a person that is living the life that you want to be living, you probably won’t actually be fully converted. I saw the life they were living and knew that’s what I wanted to do.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>ADVOCACY WORK</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>Even before I got into medicine, there was always this idea that rural kids are more likely to go rural. From the beginning, I felt like I was on the back foot. I had to prove myself as someone who was actually committed even though I grew up in Sydney and was born overseas. The more I got involved in rural health, the more I got passionate about it. There’s seven million people that are living rurally at the moment. Their health outcomes are poorer, and people are having to travel long distances for care. There is a huge gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. There are so many discrepancies in the health that just don’t make sense.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>I’m trying to get as many opportunities I can to get the word out there that rural isn’t scary. People just need to try it without listening to all the myths and the misconceptions out there. There is a world of rural medicine out here that is exciting, rewarding and you can make such a difference to people’s lives.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>CHOOSING OBSTETRICS AS A SPECIAL SKILL</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>I think one of the biggest pieces of advice that I would be giving people who are keen on doing rural generalism is decide early if you would rather the special skill be your priority or whether it’s the geographical area that you want to end up in.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>I wanted to do what would make my husband happy as well. He wanted to settle in this Hunter New England region in New South Wales. As an intern, I started to visit some of the towns that were around here. I said, “what advanced skill do you guys need? Do you need someone who’s got anaesthetics skills? Do you need someone who’s got mental health, paediatrics? What is it that we’re really short of?”</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>The vast majority of towns around here were desperate for obstetrics. I was like, well, that’s decided then. I’m going to do obstetrics, and I’ve loved it. If I get called out in the middle of the night for a lady that’s in labour, and I’m there for that super special moment when the baby is born and you see how happy the mum and the dad are, that is not work to me. That’s a privilege.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>CORONAVIRUS</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>There’s lots of talk about clinics not having enough personal protective equipment. It’s true. At the moment we don’t have enough masks to be seeing people who are unwell at the practice. Some patients are pretty much refusing to come in because they’re so scared that they’re going to pick something up. Now we’re experiencing people who are either passing away in their homes or people coming in with more advanced disease than we were seeing before. Everyone’s really worried about what it’s going to be like once we realize there’s so many people that are really, really unwell at home and refusing to come in. I think that’s going to be a big change.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>FINDING BALANCE</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>I’m really fortunate that I’ve got a partner who’s really supportive and who’s been supporting me from day one. He supported me through medical school when I didn’t have an income, then having a baby in medical school, and doing obstetrics training. I can’t believe he’s forgiven me for the ridiculous number of hours I was doing in obstetrics.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>I really like a quote that someone used to always tell me. ‘Find your why and that will help you to find your how’. If you find something that you’re really passionate about, all of a sudden you work out ways to fit things in. I want my son to grow up and know that if you work really hard, life is going to be okay. If you help other people, it’s going to give you more than you give.</Blog.Text>
