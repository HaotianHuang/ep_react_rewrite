            <Blog.Text>‚ñ∂Ô∏è 00:36‚Äç</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>I was approached about taking up one of the military scholarships during my third year of medical school. As part of that process, you get paid a salary, rent allowance and get textbooks covered - it's quite a good deal! In return, you have to commit to military service for a specified period. I took the scholarship for two-and-a-half years (through the fourth, fifth, and sixth years of my medical school training) and then completed my intern and resident years at Monash Health.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>After that I was a full-time medical officer for the Navy. The first six months in the Navy was officer training doing the ‚Äúyes sir, no sir, three bags full sir‚Äù, lots of pushups (never been fitter), 5:30 starts and all the traditional military activities(zooming around in boats, shooting raffles, blowing up stuff) - which was entirely non-medical!</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>After that there was medical work: the bulk of my military medical work was being involved inOperation Resolute, which involved border patrol and providing humanitarian aid to the refugees that came over by boat. We would intercept the refugees during some pretty horrific circumstances, and serve some very unwell people.  </Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>In these ‚Äúaustere environments‚Äù,you have to think on your feet: boats are rocking around, the place is full of diesel fumes and you have people coming in with large lacerations, pregnancy and chronic illnesses - all requiring medical care.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>You have to patch them up the best you can, before they get transferred to various processing facilities. I thought it was horrific that we're sending them to detention centers on islands, because it's just not the way you treat refugees, but you can at least try and provide a little bit of comfort and be a smiling face for them. </Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>I had a few other overseas deployments which were a bit more fun. I went over to Hawaii as we tested some missile systems and did some stuff with the US and then did a deployment to China - a diplomatic one - where we were celebrating People's Liberation(Navy‚Äôs 60th anniversary) and I got to play around with the Russians and all the other navies from around the globe.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Text><b>‚ñ∂Ô∏è 04:04‚Äç</b></Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>The longer you stay in the military, the less clinical you become and your role becomes more of a medical administrator, which was not a career path I was interested in. There's also a lot of time away. By that stage I found my partner and the concept of spending up to 12 months away on deployment was a tough ask. So it became pretty obvious that I didn't really want to stay in the military. But I got some great training while I was there, including diving and aviation medicine, which are transferable clinical skills to the civilian world.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Text><b>‚ñ∂Ô∏è 06:59‚Äç</b></Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>The bottom line for anyone thinking about the military is if you want to work full time for the military, then general practice is your only option.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>Recruiting will probably tell you: ‚ÄúOh, you can be an orthopedic surgeon, you can be a trauma surgeon, you can do whatever you like.‚Äù</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>The bottom line is they don't need that - they need reserve specialists. So the military has a lot of reserve specialists, but for full-time doctors they only need GPs. If you are a student thinking about taking up one of the military scholarships and you're not interested in general practice, then don‚Äôt even look at it! The other thing I would say is that the money is very enticing. They offer you this great salary package and tell you that you'll be debt free - but you should never do anything for money in medicine, because you are signing up with the military and you have to be inclined in that way!</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Text><b>‚ÄçType 1 - People that will never serve in the military:</b> ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about? That's ridiculous. I'm will never be interested in doing that, you have to be crazy to join the military.‚Äù These are the people that will never be convinced to join.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text><b>Type 2 - Can be convinced to join in the right circumstances:</b> ‚ÄúOh, I haven't really thought about the military, but it sounds like it might be interesting, that could be something I do.‚Äù</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text><b>Type 3 - Born to serve:</b> People with a family history of military service and have always been interested in military culture - that's certainly where I fall into.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>My grandfather was the Surgeon General for the Australian Navy, he served in World War Two. So I had a family tradition of both medicine and military; growing up I was always interested in military documentaries.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>I think the people that tend to do the best in the military are the people that have always been interested in it. On the other hand if it's something that you're doing for fun or are not sure about, it's a big deal to take on, and in that case I would think long and hard before going down that road.‚Äç</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Text><b>‚ñ∂Ô∏è09:13</b></Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>An alternative way to engage in military service is through The Reserves. It can still be really rewarding while requiring less commitment. You can do your specialist training and then sign on as a reservist. You only have to give them one weekend per month or a couple of weeks a year. You get tax-free pay, and generally the reservists only get called in times of crisis, which is when most people want to give their service and their time.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>I've worked with a number of reservists during my full-time service. There's some very senior clinicians: Dr Habersberger, one of the chief cardiologists at the Alfred, is very high up in the Navy reserves.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text><i>There's a surprising number of very senior clinicians in hospitals that do reserve work and it's a great little social network as well. It is a great way to have contacts particularly in the specialties you're interested in!</i></Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Text>The RACGP slogan ‚Äúspecialist in life‚Äù is controversial within GP circles. A lot of GPs hate that term, but I quite like it.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>I think if you just do the medicine, then you miss out as a GP. I think being involved in patients' lives is the most rewarding part of it.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>People are thankful for a good GP. You hear a lot of people say: ‚ÄúI can't find a good GP, GPs are rubbish‚Äù. There is a lot of negative sentiment and it's because they haven't found a GP that they have bonded with and has become a part of their lives. When you interview patients with good GPs, they say that GPs are the most important part of their medical care.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Text>I am a member of the Facebook group called ‚ÄúGPs Down Under‚Äù and have been watching the GPs post over the last couple of weeks about responding to the bushfires near their practices. They're setting up little emergency clinics, bringing in drugs, speaking to specialists to learn how they can provide appropriate care when they become isolated when major roads are cut off. People have been turning to their GPs because of respiratory problems with smoke inhalation and the trauma of losing their houses. If being a part of this response is something you would love, then general practice is definitely the career for you.‚Äç</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Text>A couple of years after leaving the Navy I started looked for education work, which was part of my military through educating medics in the Navy. So I approached Monash University and worked for the department of General Practice for a number of years and then moved across to the Peninsula clinical school.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Text>Why setting up your finances early should be a priority.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text><b>‚ñ∂Ô∏è17:31</b></Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>Within medicine it's seems almost taboo to talk about money.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>The bottom line is that in medicine it doesn't matter what pathway you pick, you're never going to be short of a dollar.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>The main thing that prompted me to talk about money and medicine, is that I have friends that are specialists earning uber-dollars that are struggling to pay their bills and have debt coming out their eyeballs. They haven't managed their finances properly. I was hoping to instil in this cohort, some financial habits that you can set up early on to help avoid failure later in life.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>As doctors we get focused on medicine, which is rightfully where our priorities should be. That can leave a lot of other aspects of our lives in a bit of chaos. If you set up your finances early - in terms of your bank accounts, savings plans, super and investment strategies, you will find it easier later on. The last thing you want to be thinking about when you're a cardiothoracics registrar having just done your 30th hour on call: ‚Äú Oh my God, I'm not sure if I actually set up my loan repayments to come out properly.‚Äù</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>I've adopted a few financial strategies along the way from Warren Buffett and the Barefoot Investor. I think being interested in money helps you value it more to treat it with the respect it needs, or else it can become another source of stress.‚Äç</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Text><b>‚ñ∂Ô∏è19:47</b></Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text><b>‚úÖTip 1: Set up your super properly.</b></Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>It's always better to have more money going into super than you think you need, and to make sure that you're investing in the right style of super.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>As young junior doctors you are going to be in the workforce for 30 to 40 years, you have the time to ride out the highs and lows of the share market - so put your super into high growth portfolios and make sure that your super is a low-fee super fund.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text><b>‚úÖTip 2: Think about a savings plan.</b> As your salary increases, you get hit by what they call ‚Äúlifestyle creep‚Äù - when your expenses rise with your income.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>You go from a medical student earning $0, to an intern earning $60,000 to $80,000, then to a consultant ophthalmologist earning $2-3 millions a year. You can find that the consultant ophthalmologist earning $2-3 millions a year has no savings in the bank, as opposed to a junior doctor who has been doing locum HMO work for 10 years who has a million dollars in the bank. The main difference between them is that one has managed not to fall victim to lifestyle creep!</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>Warren Buffett's famous quote is: ‚ÄúSpend what is left after saving. Don't save what is left after spending.‚Äù</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text><b>‚úÖTip 3: Ensure your insurances and contingencies in place.</b></Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>You never know what's around the corner. One of the GPs affected by the bushfire crisis on Kangaroo Island posted about his home being burnt down. His town is shut down, people have evacuated, his clinic is not generating any income and his home is burnt down.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>You want to make sure that you are prepared for the unexpected.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>You should always have three months expenses in an easily accessible bank account. Income protection insurance kicks in only after about 10-to-12 weeks, during which you‚Äôll need to be able to live off your savings. You have to make sure that you have that aside (and that you're not spending it on the latest holiday to the Maldives!)‚Äç‚Äç</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Text>‚Äç<b>Is investing in the share market risky business?</b></Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text><b>‚ñ∂Ô∏è24:30</b></Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>For a lot of people the default is to just put all their savings in the bank. Particularly at the moment with interest rates so low, you would be missing out on so much lost income by doing that. Everyone thinks that the share market is immensely complicated, difficult and risky. But it's not. There's a reason why superannuation funds invest primarly in the ASX 200, which comprises the top 200 companies in Australia - because it is safe. Even if you go with a relatively conservative super portfolio, you will still find that a large chunk of that money will be invested in blue chip Australian shares. If you invest in the ASX 200, through buying some shares in Woolworths, CommBank, Wesfarmers for a 20-to-30 year investment plan - you would find it pretty hard to stuff up!</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>Don't put all your eggs in one basket; it is important to have a good diversified portfolio.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>Occasionally disasters happen, but if it is only 2% of your portfolio, you can endure it.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Text><b>‚ñ∂Ô∏è32:25</b></Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>There's a lot of doctors who are politically minded and there are loads of opportunities for that. For example Richard Di Natale is a doctor who felt that he would better serve the country as a politician.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>The RACGP never used to have anything resembling a political presence, but lately it's becoming more of a political organisation. I think doctors are a powerful force if we want to be. The problem is that we're a hard group to coordinate. Even on issues like climate change where we have an unanimous position (both AMA and RACGP have come out with statements) and special interest groups such as Doctors for the Environment, we are not really prominent or influential. We are a hard group to coordinate because our focus is always on patients - that's where it should be. Patient outcomes come first , but it doesn't mean that we can't have these secondary roles.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>I think campaigning for change that we‚Äôre passionate about is important for us. We are in the position that we have exposure to the general public.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>I talk about climate change a lot with my patients. They say that the golden rule is ‚ÄúDon't talk politics with your patients‚Äù. I do avoid politics in general, but I think when there's issues such as climate change that are affecting health, we should be advocates in that space. Definitely make your voices heard - junior doctors in particular. We're seeing that the horrendous bullying of junior doctors that has happened in the past is gradually changing, and the only people able to generate change is junior doctors speaking out. So don‚Äôt be silent. As a collective voice we can be powerful, as well as individually.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Text>My wife always laughs because I'm an ‚Äúadvocate of the sternly worded letter‚Äù as I love to write to politicians. I love to complain about things that need to be changed. People always think that it doesn't accomplish anything, but every time I write to a politician I always get a response. It might not be the response you want, but at least it's flagging issues and they become aware of what challenges are faced. At the moment it seems like politicians are very out of step with a lot of the stuff that we're doing, particularly on climate change - so be vocal, be passionate and take it personally!</Blog.Text>
