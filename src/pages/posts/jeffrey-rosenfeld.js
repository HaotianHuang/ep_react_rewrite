            <Blog.Subtitle>FIRST SURGERY</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>My first operation was doing an appendectomy as a first year intern at the Royal Melbourne Hospital in 1977. I had about 20 medical students standing around the operating table, watching what I was doing.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle><i>WELL SORRY JEFFREY, YOU’RE NOT SUITED FOR SURGERY.</i></Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>My first general rotation was to Horsham, a fairly remote location in Victoria. I was doing surgery of a scope that I'd never done before. The surgeon who was there judged my performance after three months to not be up to what he thought a surgical registrar should be able to do. He told me, “Jeffrey, I'm not going to recommend you to continue in surgery, because you're not suited to it.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>I could have told myself, “Right, he's right, I'm giving up surgery.” I could have been completely destroyed by that comment. But I decided that no - I believed he was wrong because I knew I could achieve what was required given the chance.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>I overcame the obstacle and said no, I think I can do surgery. I know I've got the capabilities to do it. This is really what I want to do. This is what I've decided, I have to do this. I'm going to go all out to try and do it.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>INVENTING A WORLD-STANDARD SURGICAL PROCEDURE</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>I had patients coming from over the world for the operation: one from Tanzania, a number from Europe and even some from the US. It was unheard of for US patients to come to Australia for their treatment - it’s always the other way - but I actually had them coming here.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>It’s hypothalamic hamartoma: a small tumour that develops from before birth and causes very severe epilepsy in young children. I developed this operation which was different to all the others that had been done before.</Blog.Text>
