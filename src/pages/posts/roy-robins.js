            <Blog.Text><b>Profile:</b> A class-act in microbiology and immunology, an encyclopedia of knowledge, a longstanding educator and an avid admirer of the variable life forms - from the smallest to the biggest - that inhabit the earth. Recently elected an Officer of the Order of Australia, he is a humble individual, a charismatic storyteller, a passionate biologist and a proud father of three daughters. A conversation with Professor Robins-Browne is unlike any other, as few people in the world manage to teach you about microbes, diseases, history, culture, politics, animals and cheese in one sitting. This is an interview with Professor Robins-Browne, two years after his retirement from his full-time position at the University of Melbourne.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text><b>Note:</b> the comments on COVID-19 correspond to an earlier date, before the global escalation of the current lockdown situation in many parts of the world (interview was conducted on February 26th, 2020).</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>Life before medicine</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>I was born and raised in South Africa. I was an only child, so I was used to getting my own way – at least some of the time.  My father was a doctor, but my mother came from a non-medical family. My father died shortly before my 12th birthday, and my mother just before my 21st birthday.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>I went to a government school. There were many things I liked about school, mainly the sciences and maths. After school, I looked at jobs related to the sciences, but I wasn’t sure. Some of my mother’s medical friends said I should do medicine because I could use it in so many different areas. So, I entered medical school with an open mind.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>Medical school</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>I liked everything I did at medical school, but I was unusual in that I absolutely loved pathology. I felt it was the first time the lecturers treated us as adults. They explained how conditions developed and then questioned our understanding. For histology, they gave us a big box of slides to look at and make diagnoses. The idea that you could look down a microscope and work out what was wrong with someone really appealed to me. By the end of medical school, I knew I wanted to do pathology.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>Challenges as a young doctor: <i>“Scrubs is the most realistic TV show I’ve ever watched”</i></Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>When I graduated, I was reluctant to do a residency because I was set on pathology, but I was told that if I didn’t do a residency, I wouldn’t be a registered doctor - I’d just have a degree. So I did it, and it taught me that everything you do professionally is useful.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>One thing I learned from my residency, which I didn’t as a student, is how to get organised. You had to be well prepared for the morning ward round, anticipate what people would require of you. It’s like what you see on the show Scrubs. That’s the most realistic medical show I’ve ever watched. Sure, we experienced bullying, but it was the gentle kind. The main thing was avoiding public humiliation. If you were asked: “What’s that patient’s haemoglobin?” and replied: “I don’t know”, you’d be told, “I don’t know isn’t a value.” So, the lesson was to get organised and find ways to get things done.  </Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>“<i>It’s amazing how things turn out”</i> – from choosing pathology, to being chosen for microbiology</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>In the year of my internship, my University (the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg) formed a School of Pathology by amalgamating the University Department of Pathology with a clinical pathology institute: The South African Institute for Medical Research. The aim was to address the shortage of pathologists who were prepared to teach. I asked the Director of the Institute for a training position in anatomical pathology, but there were no vacancies. Instead, he offered me one in microbiology, and I took it.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>I then trained in haematology because it was a small subject compared to microbiology, and I thought it would be good to balance these two disciplines. People would ask me how I found hematology after microbiology. I’d joke and say that in microbiology there are thousands of microbes and other infectious agents, but in hematology, there are only three types cell you need to know. I mean, platelets aren’t even cells - just bits of cells. So, after a week, you could know it all!</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>The curveball that set off the path to becoming an expert in E. coli</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>I enjoyed haematology so much that I wanted to do sub-specialise and do a PhD in it. I was planning to do a project on idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, but my boss told me he couldn’t supervise me because he’d been promoted and wouldn’t have the time. As I said, I was an only child and was used to getting my way. I was upset and felt rejected. So, I walked out of the Haematology office and went straight to the Microbiology office to see my former boss. I told him I’d decided to come back to microbiology to complete my pathology training and do a PhD project. He said, “That’s fantastic because I’ve just been awarded a grant to investigate the causes of diarrhoea in black African children.”</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>The best part about my PhD research was that I had to do “real” science, meaning that I had to try to prove myself wrong. At the time, rotavirus and enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) were newly discovered causes of diarrhoea, and my research hypothesis was that they would account for most cases of diarrhoea in my study population. However, I found that enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) was the most prevalent pathogen in these children. This was an unpopular idea at the time. In fact, there was an article in the New England Journal of Medicine that referred to “so-called” enteropathogenic E. coli.  At the time, I was one of the few researchers in the world who believed that EPEC was a pathogen. Then came enterohaemorrhagic and enteroaggregative E. coli. I was a member of the team that discovered the latter.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>Practicing infectious diseases in South Africa</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>Practicing infectious diseases in South Africa in the 1970s and 1980s was amazing. In Durban hospital where I ran the diagnostic microbiology laboratory, on any one day I could find a case of tetanus, rabies, or tuberculous meningitis. When doctors visited our hospital from overseas, they’d ask to see interesting cases. So, I’d take them on a ward round to the paediatric ICU and point out a baby with neonatal tetanus – a condition my visitors thought only happened in textbooks. Even I was surprised by some cases. For example, a doctor once told me he had a patient with a typhoid breast abscess. I asked how he knew, and he said they had drawn pus out of the breast and it grew Salmonella Typhi.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>I also received some very bizarre phone calls, such as when I was called about a patient who had been bitten by a lion. The treating team called me because they thought the lion may have been rabid, but they couldn’t confirm it because it had run away. I asked them why they thought it was rabid, and they said because the lion came into the village and started attacking people at random, which was not normal lion behaviour.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>Take on COVID-19 (pre-declaration by WHO as a pandemic)</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>It's hard to prophesy about this, because the situation changes every day, but I think it's highly unlikely we're going to escape this in Australia. It seems to be more contagious and virulent than your average flu strain. It could be quite bad, but I hope I’m wrong. The hope of containing it was always remote, and that battle has been lost. It meets the definition of a pandemic, even though WHO hasn’t declared it yet.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>The good news for people who survive COVID19 is that they may never get another cold from coronavirus. They’ll still get colds from adenovirus, rhinovirus, etc., but probably not from coronavirus.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>Daughters at home, students at the university</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>All three of my daughters are doctors, and they all graduated from the University of Melbourne. I taught all of them and it was fantastic, in part, because I wasn’t allowed to do any assessment those years.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>My daughters’ friends would come over and tell me “Roy, that joke you told today was terrible.” After we moved houses, I would drive my youngest daughter to University. A friend of hers who lived close said “You might as well give me a lift, too” and then asked me to explain things to him in the car. So, he got a tute as well as a ride!</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>Wildlife and underwater photography</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>I'm a keen photographer. It started when I got a Brownie box camera for my 7th birthday. Since then, I’ve always owned a camera. I currently have four, not counting my phone.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>I mostly like taking wildlife photos, but I’ll photograph anything. I do underwater photography too when I snorkel. The Medical Journal of Australia has published some of my wildlife photos.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>Some time ago, I took a tour in Alaska where I met a professional photographer, who told me if I liked animal photography I had to go to South Georgia. I did that last year. They have fur seals there, which were nearly wiped out a hundred year ago due to hunting. But the most aggressive ones survived, and South Georgia is now home to 95% of the world’s population of around 4 million southern fur seals.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>Proudest personal achievements</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>I’m incredibly proud of the PhD students I’ve trained. Several of them have gone on to do wonderful things. One of them is the Director of Hudson Medical Research Institute; five are full professors. They are my legacy.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>I was also proud of the teaching award that I won in 2016 (at the University of Melbourne). I was the Head of the Department Microbiology and Immunology for seven years. During this period, I stayed on as coordinator of the medical microbiology course. Usually, Department Heads give up subject co-ordination, because it was too much work doing both jobs while running your research group. I received fantastic support at work and at home, which allowed me to take on the headship while retaining my other responsibilities.  </Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>Medical career advice: Do it for the love</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>When I told my relatives I was going to specialise in microbiology, they said, “We’ve got vaccines and antibiotics. What’s left for you to do?” They didn't know about coronavirus … nor did I, but that's the thing. You never know what the next big issue in medicine will be. I specialised in micro because it interested me. So, my advice is: Do what you like and do it for the right reason, because pursuing a life-long career that you don't enjoy isn’t worth it. To paraphrase my mother’s friends: If you are curious, there will always be a branch of medicine that interests you. I got into teaching, research and postgraduate student supervision, as well as the other things I’ve done because of this and have never regretted it.</Blog.Text>
