            <Blog.Author>Interviewed and Written by Jonathan Tsiglopoulos</Blog.Author>
            <Blog.Text>With only 30 years of life under his belt Dr Robert Gillies OAM has managed to find himself pursuing an incredible number of interests - both within and outside of Medicine.  From philosophy to philanthropy, the former Young Australian of the Year has studied 4 university degrees and started the same number of charities, including his most recent involvement as Co-Founder of HoMie - a streetwear clothing social enterprise which aims to support young people experiencing homelessness or hardship. Dr Gillies continues to oversee the various charities as a board member and is currently pursuing a career in Psychiatry at the Alfred Hospital. </Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>FROM PHILOSOPHY TO PHILANTHROPY </Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>For me it wasn’t about wanting to do more degrees. I went into medicine because I wanted to be a psychiatrist. I always found the science was interesting, but it wasn’t enough. I’m also interested in the humanities - psychology, politics and philosophy. I took up the opportunity with Monash to do a diploma of philosophy, as well as some research and a Masters of Public Health as a way of keeping me sane and getting through all the science within Medicine. </Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>During medical school I became frustrated in not being as active in the community as I would have liked. I had a lot of energy, which led me to doing some volunteer work over my summer holidays. I travelled throughout Southeast Asia and taught English to people who would’ve otherwise been unable to afford it. I figured it would be a good way to help disadvantaged people to find work in things like tourism. </Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>This made me curious about what disadvantage might look like in Australia, which then led me to undertaking some social work roles in the Northern territory during my summer holidays. </Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>INVOLVEMENT WITH HoMie </Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>Some friends of mine were running a Facebook page where they would talk to people on the streets of Melbourne who were living rough. They were trying to get an understanding of what it was like to live on the street. They would post the conversations on social media in order to raise awareness by providing a platform through which these narratives would be shared. I offered to get involved and together we grew the Facebook page into something quite significant. This gave us the appropriate platform on which to expand.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>In 2015 we decided to start the organisation HoMie to provide clothing to people experiencing homelessness - but not in the traditional way that clothing is distributed to the homeless community. This would be an actual shop, in an actual shopping centre, and it would invite people who were living rough to have a dignified shopping experience. They would shop for free and receive firsthand clothing that actually fit them, with the <strong><em>purpose of providing a service that people would recognize the shared humanity in.</em></strong></Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>DOING THINGS OUTSIDE OF MEDICINE </Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>An important first step is to educate yourself and raise your own awareness through reading, conversation, travel or getting involved in community activities. When I started volunteering 10 years ago, I had no idea that I would start charities or work with such communities. It was initially just a journey to educate myself, and then once you’re immersed in an issue or idea for long enough you tend to notice ways in which you can contribute. It doesn’t even have to be starting your own project - a lot of medical students contribute through medical research, which is a really appropriate way to contribute.</Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>My greatest advice would be not to worry about where it’s leading or what you might achieve. Just be curious and willing to learn, which is what we are good at as medical students anyway! </Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>CHALLENGES FACING HOMELESSNESS TODAY </Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>Homelessness is a very complex issue. It’s the outcome of a lot of other disadvantages or social issues. It’s an outcome of other problematic phenomena in society, such as family violence, mental illness, drug use, financial disadvantage and social isolation. Working in Psychiatry and through HoMie I’ve had a lot of exposure to some of the potential solutions and avenues for change - and you do see an optimistic trajectory in a number of areas. Over the past 5-10 years a lot of new services have been initiated. I do think that circumstances are getting better, but it’s a rocky road with numerous ups and downs. Despite that, this remains an issue that’s not even close to being resolved as there are still a lot of systemic issues that need to be solved first.  </Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>COVID AND HOMELESSNESS</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>It’s been incredibly difficult for vulnerable people. Domestic abuse and family violence are presumed to have increased over this time, and although we don’t have the data yet, it’s likely to have been a very difficult time for those experiencing homelessness. There’s a concern that victims are being locked at home with their abusers more often, and potentially more substance abuse occurring. </Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>MOTIVATION</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>I think that having effective role models was instrumental to me pursuing pathways I would have otherwise not taken. I was exposed to different people throughout my life who were engaging in different and novel things, and this opened my mind to the possibilities of pursuing various interests. I think of a good friend who was studying medicine at James Cook University and started a program called “Run to Better Days”. They would run the length of Queensland and stop off at schools every day to provide educational seminars about poverty and effective altruism. It blew my mind that people our age could create such an organisation, and this got me thinking about ways in which I could create new or novel innovative projects to help those in the community.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>BEST LESSON YOU’VE LEARNT IN LIFE  </Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text><strong><em>Opportunity is reward in itself.</em></strong> If you are ever on the fence about doing something, especially if it’s scary or uncomfortable - just give it a go (as long as you can do it in a safe way). That’s what led me all over the world and in different directions - being open to opportunity. The wilder and more uncomfortable it was – the more it would lead to growth.  You can’t worry too much about the future. </Blog.Text>
            <Blog.Text>On that note, a lot of people ask me if I have a 5- or 10-year plan. I’ve never been one of those people. I strove to create a life where it wasn’t possible to know what I would be doing in 5 to 10 years. Even 3 or 6 months I wasn’t sure what I would be doing. It can be scary and destabilising but it’s also so exciting. It’s a rewarding way to live life when you don’t know what’s coming but are still open to any opportunities that come your way </Blog.Text>
