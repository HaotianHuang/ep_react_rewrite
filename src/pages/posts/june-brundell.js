            <Blog.Text><i>Dr June Brundell is a climate scientist turned doctor and is currently a GP registrar in Stanthorpe, Queensland – a town of 5,000 with two interns. We sit down today with June to unravel the political and social aspects of being a climate doctor.</i></Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Text>I studied as an undergraduate in Environmental Management, majoring in Natural Systems and Wildlife, and I worked for nine years in roles ranging from land care, pasture science, and mining rehab. My favourite job was at the Queensland Climate Change Centre for Excellence as a research assistant, and doing extension work delivering educational workshops across the state. We would most often work with land care groups, producers, graziers, fisheries and some pearl growers too. Our climate risk workshops involved speaking to our stakeholders about regional climate forecasts, guiding them through a risk and vulnerability assessment, and helping them develop plans to adapt to climatic variation.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>WHAT LED YOU TO MOVING AWAY FROM CLIMATE SCIENCE WORK?</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>Funnily enough, politics. When the Rudd government came on in 2007 there was a change in the funding structures and a lot of environmental scientists lost their jobs. There was no job security after that. I realised that I couldn’t really build a career: there wasn’t the mentorship, and there wasn’t the ability to focus on an area and develop yourself forward which I really wanted. I found it really frustrating and unfulfilling. So I looked around to see what my options were and medicine seemed like a really good idea because I have always been interested in it despite saying many times that I never wanted to be a doctor.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>EVERYONE KEEPS TALKING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE. HOW DOES IT AFFECT OUR HEALTH?</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>Not only does it have primary and secondary effects, it’s also going to affect key social determinants of health; food security, water security, liveable areas, living space with sea level rises and climate refugees. In addition to that, heat itself affects health. During a heat wave for example, you’ll have an increased number of dehydration events, acute kidney injuries, acute coronary syndromes and CVAs. It’s not just the daytime temperatures but if you don’t get night time cooling, then your body doesn’t get a chance to reset while it sleeps, and that’s when you tend to have the greatest risk.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>SIMPLE QUESTION - HOW DO YOU FIX CLIMATE CHANGE</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>I actually don’t think that this is rocket science; I think it’s quite obvious there needs to be a societal and cultural shift and that we need to transition into renewable resources. Australia is uniquely poised: we have limitless solar energy, and we also have access to wave energy which is an option given that a large amount of our population is costal, and we certainly have plenty of wind to compensate for when it’s not sunny. I figure if countries in the UK and Europe can run primarily on solar, then we should be able to too. What’s preventing this from happening is political will. We’ve got a very reactive government that doesn’t like to believe the science because it doesn’t fit the paradigm of how they think the world should work. They seem to think that science is quite debatable when it’s not really. The science behind climate change has a greater evidence base and better level of certainty than most things we do in medicine. I think the government is very much focused on a short term electoral timeframe of three-to-four years. I doubt that they have the proactive visionary ability to move forward and deal with the big issues.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>LET'S TALK ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE CLINICAL SETTING. AS A GP, DOES THE TOPIC COME UP OFTEN? WHAT DO YOU SAY TO CLIMATE CHANGE DENIERS IN CLINIC?</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>Not particularly. If it comes up, I’m happy to discuss it. Most people are actually quite comfortable that this drought is a climate change driven result. We haven’t had a drought like this before; we haven’t had fires like this before. This is not a normal event. But I’m not the right person to deal with climate change deniers – they are one of the reasons I left climate science. I’m very fact driven, so I like to present people with facts. Unfortunately, facts don’t change people’s minds; stories change people’s minds, and it’s got to come from a credible source.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY THAT DOCTORS SHOULD MIND THEIR OWN BUSINESS AND TREAT PATIENTS RATHER THAN WASTE TIME ON ADVOCACY FOR CLIMATE ACTIONS. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT?</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>I play a role in public health, so to use a very old climate change technique: we don’t talk about climate change, we talk about climate risk and climate variability. So I’d always argue that the weather impacts on the physical and mental health of my community, therefore it is very much my job to advocate for them in climate change and the climate change effects on health.</Blog.Text>

            <Blog.Subtitle>LET'S FINISH OFF WITH ONE PIECE OF ADVICE FOR OUR MEDICAL STUDENTS</Blog.Subtitle>
            <Blog.Text>Keep an open mind. The things you don’t think you’re going to find interesting, you will find fascinating, and the things you think you might love, you might hate. This advice was given to me a lot and certainly I found it to be true. So open your mind, open your ears, take off your blinkers and look around.</Blog.Text>
